    "text": "The US has pulled further ahead of China in the race for world’s biggest economy, thanks in part to a vibrant American consumer. US gross domestic product rose 6.3% in nominal terms — that is, unadjusted for inflation — last year, outpacing China’s 4.6% gain. While some of the outperformance reflected America’s elevated price increases, the 2023 outturn underscores a broader point: The US economy is emerging from the pandemic period in a better place than China’s. “It is a striking turn of fortunes,” said Eswar Prasad, who once led the International Monetary Fund’s China team and is now at Cornell University. “The strong performance of the US economy, in tandem with all the short-term and long-term headwinds the Chinese economy is facing, renders it a less obvious proposition that China’s GDP will someday overtake that of the US.” The economic outperformance is reflected in the respective countries’ stock markets. US shares have hit all-time highs this week, while Chinese equities are mired in a $6 trillion-plus bear-market rout. It wasn’t expected to be this way. At the start of last year, the US was widely tipped to fall into a recession as the Federal Reserve jacked up interest rates to combat an inflation scourge not seen in decades. China, on the other hand, was expected to experience a rip-roaring recovery as it reopened its economy fully to commerce after strict lockdowns to combat the spread of Covid-19. That’s not what happened. GDP data released on Thursday showed the US economy ended the year with a bang, growing 3.3% in real, inflation-adjusted terms in the fourth quarter after expanding 4.9% in the third. Inflation is on its way back down to the Fed’s 2% target and fears of a recession are fading. Property Bust China, by contrast, is struggling under the weight of a years-long real estate bust and its worst streak of deflation in some 25 years. Exports — once a critical pillar of growth — declined in 2023, joblessness among young people has soared and local governments are saddled with too much debt. While government figures show the economy met the authorities’ annual growth target, by expanding 5.2% in 2023, there are suspicions that isn’t a true picture of what’s going on.

Not All Agree Rubin Says US in a ‘Terrible Place’ on Deficit, Urges Tax Hikes CHINA INSIGHT: New Forecast Says GDP May Never Hold No. 1 Spot To be sure, nominal GDP isn’t the only way to measure the size of a country’s economy. Economists also use something called purchasing power parity, which tries to take account of differences in prices between countries for the same good or service. On that basis, as calculated by Bloomberg Economics, China overtook the US around 2016: A dollar in China simply buys a lot more that it does in the US. But many observers don’t think that’s the best way to measure economic heft on the world stage. For that, nominal GDP is seen as a better guide. Power Issue “The pandemic covered up a lot of China’s weaknesses that are deep and structural and will last through the decade — depending on their ability to reform,” said Josh Lipsky, a former IMF adviser who is now director of the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center. Peterson Institute for International Economics President Adam Posen argues that Chinese President Xi Jinping has greatly compounded the country’s underlying economic weaknesses by his arbitrary and authoritarian exercise of power throughout the economy and society, particularly during the pandemic. That’s spooked households and small businesses into hoarding cash, because they just don’t know what’s coming next. It’s a malady that Posen has called “economic long Covid” — a chronic condition marked by a lack of vitality and extended sluggishness. The US, meanwhile, has surprised economists with the resiliency of its economy coming out the pandemic. Some like Posen even suspect the country may be on the cusp of a pickup in productivity growth that will allow the economy to grow faster without generating inflation. However, the final act in the Fed’s campaign to return US inflation to its 2% target has yet to be written. There’s still a risk it could keep policy too tight for too long, and precipitate a downturn. The jobs market is showing signs of weakening at the edges. As a result, MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC founder and former Fed economist Julia Coronado told an American Enterprise Institute webinar on Wednesday the risks of a recession are higher now than at the start of 2023, though her base case remains that one will be avoided. The US has longer-term concerns as well, including a historically high budget deficit. Still, the story from last year is clear. “All the talk of China becoming the world’s largest economy by GDP has been put on the backburner and delayed, if not indefinitely postponed,” Lipsky said.

Estimated U.S. economic growth for the year is up from the 2.5% growth it experienced in 2023, and 0.6 percentage points higher than the IMF’s previous calculation.\n\nBehind the surprising growth is strong [consumer demand](https://fortune.com/2024/04/15/economy-outlook-2024-no-landing-more-inflation-growth-fewer-rate-cuts-wells-fargo/) that has buoyed the U.S. economy despite the setback of COVID-19 and geopolitical disturbances such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to Tuesday’s report.\n\n“Astonishingly, the U.S. economy has already surged past its prepandemic trend,” economists for the IMF wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s usually gangbusters economy, while having recently reported [strong first-quarter numbers](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/04/16/china-good-start-gdp-growth-disappointing-march-data-retail-sales-industrial-output-home-sales/), could be unsteady in the long run, with the IMF projecting the country’s growth to slow to 4.6% for the year, compared to 5.2% in 2023.\n\nChina, which has for months been dealing with a [real estate crisis](https://fortune.com/2024/03/11/china-real-estate-evergrande-debt-ni-hong-parliamentary/), could exacerbate its economic problems by failing to address them immediately, according to the report.\n\n“In the absence of a comprehensive restructuring policy package for the troubled property sector in China, a larger and more prolonged drop in real estate investment could occur, accompanied by expectations of future house prices declining, reduced housing demand, and a further weakening in household confidence and spending, with implications for global growth,” the report said.\n\nWhile the U.S. is leading the world in growth, its performance in the years to come is uncertain as still-elevated inflation numbers have cast doubt on whether the Federal Reserve would cut rates [as expected](https://fortune.com/2024/03/20/fed-interest-rate-cuts-3-2024-stocks/) by the end of the year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell scaled back his previous outlook on rate cuts. Powell said the hot inflation measures, including a CPI of 3.5% in March (a 0.3% percentage-point increase from February), have “clearly not given us greater confidence,” adding that the data instead “indicate that it is likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,” the _Wall Street Journal_ [reported](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/powell-dials-back-expectations-on-rate-cuts-00e3e5d0?mod=breakingnews).\n\nThe IMF echoed Powell’s concern in the World Economic Outlook, stating that central banks worldwide need to ensure that “inflation touches down smoothly.” Although many investors and market onlookers had expected multiple rate cuts for the year, inflation has changed the calculation for the Fed.\n\n“The exceptional recent performance of the United States is certainly impressive and a major driver of global growth,” the IMF report read. “But it reflects strong demand factors as well, including a fiscal stance that is out of line with long-term fiscal sustainability.”\n\nSubscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance.

    "text": "Art by ChatGPT Comparing the size of countries’ economies is a popular sport, and a lot of people are very invested in the outcomes of those comparisons. For example, I see a lot of people passing around charts like this one, claiming to show that China’s economy has fallen behind the U.S.’ since 2021: Here’s a more detailed version, from Jason Douglas and Ming Li in the WSJ, showing how forecasts of the sizes of the two economies have changed over time: In Bloomberg, Hal Brands cites this data to support his argument that the U.S. is still ahead of China in terms of global power: [N]early everyone thought China would soon overtake the US as the world’s largest economy. But that crossover point is receding ever further into the future, thanks to robust American growth and deepening Chinese stagnation…Over the past half-decade, the overall gap between the US and Chinese economies — as measured by gross domestic product — has been getting larger. So if you just look at this data, you might get the impression that China’s economy is falling behind America’s, and will fail to catch up in the future. But then if you read the news, you hear that China’s GDP is growing at a rate of “around 5%”, while the U.S. grew at only 3.1% in 2024. That’s a strong year for the U.S., but it’s not clear how China’s economy could be falling behind America’s if its growth rate is higher! The discrepancy here actually has nothing to do with whether or not China’s GDP growth is overstated. Yes, it’s possible that this is the case — for example, Rhodium Group guesstimates that China’s actual growth in 2024 was under 3%. But the charts above actually take the Chinese government’s 5% figure at face value. So why do they show China falling behind America? The actual reason for the discrepancy is that there are different ways of comparing GDP. The two basic measures are: GDP at market exchange rates, also called “nominal” GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP), also called “international dollars”, also called “adjusted for differences in the cost of living” If you use the first of these measures, you see China’s GDP falling behind America’s, as in the two charts above. But if you use the second measure, you see China’s GDP already ahead of America’s, and pulling farther ahead every year (albeit at a slower rate than before 2021): You’ll notice that this chart says “adjusted for…differences in the cost of living between countries”, and “international $”. That means PPP. Market exchange rate GDP is measured in U.S. dollars. You just take a country’s GDP numbers (which are measured in its domestic currency), convert that number to dollars using the current exchange rate, and that’s the country’s “nominal” GDP. That’s pretty easy to calculate and measure. But it means that when exchange rates shift, it makes it look like the relative sizes of different economies also shift, even if they all produce the exact same amount of stuff as before. In this case, it turns out that China’s currency (the yuan or RMB) has been depreciating against the U.S. dollar for years. Here’s a chart of how many dollars one Chinese yuan can buy: You’ll notice that the yuan was a little bit strong in early 2021, but that in late 2021 its value fell a lot. That’s a big part of the reason that China’s nominal GDP fell relative to America’s over the last three years. The slowdown in China’s official real growth rate was part of the drop, but much of it was just an effect of the cheaper yuan. In fact, the forecasts that show China failing to catch up to America over the next 15 years are almost certainly assuming that the yuan stays cheap. If the yuan appreciates, China’s nominal GDP will suddenly look like it jumped up. In fact, if China lets the yuan rise a lot, it will look like China’s economy suddenly overtook America’s in size — this is what happened in the late 1980s when Japan allowed its yen to appreciate, and Japan’s nominal GDP suddenly looked like it was almost as big as America’s. Whether market exchange rates are a good way of comparing countries’ GDP is a subject of debate. On one hand, it’s easy to measure, because exchange rates themselves are clear and unambiguous. And if you care about how many imports two different countries can buy, then market exchange rate GDP is obviously the right comparison. When China’s currency gets weaker, it means China can afford fewer imports. So if you’re in a third country like South Korea, and you’re asking “Which is a more important market for my goods, China or America?”, the answer has definitely shifted toward “America” over the last three years. And lo and behold, America recently overtook China as South Korea’s largest export market. Market exchange rate GDP might also translate into clout within international economic organizations. But on the other hand, market exchange rate GDP comparisons have some serious downsides. First of all, exchange rates can be determined by policy instead of by market fundamentals. China used to peg the yuan to the dollar. Now it uses a “managed float”, in which the exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate within a range determined by the Chinese government. In practice, this can look sort of like a peg. What this means is that if China’s government decided to change the range in which it allows the yuan to trade against the dollar, it might be able to suddenly make China’s economy look bigger than America’s in charts like the ones at the top of this post. And if China decides to make its currency cheaper in order to sell more exports to the world, it can do that too. That will make its economy look smaller in nominal terms, but in fact it will improve China’s export competitiveness, so in some ways it means China’s economy is actually stronger. More fundamentally, exchange rates don’t affect real living standards. Despite all the headlines about trade deficits and such, most of what Chinese people buy is produced within China, and most of what Americans buy is produced within America. This includes rent, medical care, transportation, and so on. That means that the material living standards of Chinese people and Americans will be determined much more by local prices than by international ones. PPP is an attempt to adjust for differences in local prices. International organizations like the World Bank send out research teams to various countries to look at local prices of things that aren’t sold on international markets — things like rent and medical care. They then assemble these into a price index. Comparing these price indices across countries gives you a PPP conversion factor that they use to compare economies. In theory, this gives a better comparison of how much actual stuff different countries produce. But there are many practical problems with this approach. First of all, the teams that the World Bank and other organizations send out to take stock of local prices won’t necessarily get a great sample of those prices. They might look too much at overpriced cities like Shanghai and not enough at small towns. Or they might look at fancy high-quality apples in a boutique grocery store, not realizing that regular apples cost much less. On top of that, PPP is often out of date. Prices can change pretty rapidly, while the teams that go out to measure PPP can’t do a thorough survey every year. This can lead to big sudden revisions that change our understanding of the past as well as the present. As if that weren’t enough, PPP also has a hard time comparing quality between different countries’ goods and services. A haircut in Japan might just be better than a haircut in America, but the people who do surveys for the World Bank may not realize this. 1 That quality difference should make Japan’s GDP (PPP) a little higher relative to America’s, but in practice the statistics will often miss it. This is especially important when it comes to the quality of big-ticket items like medical care and the housing stock. Finally, it’s difficult to compare overall prices between countries because people buy different things in different countries. One country’s people might spend more on health care and less on housing than another country’s. Do they do that because health care is more expensive there, or because they just want more medical care in the first place? It’s hard to say. All of these measurement issues lead to big discrepancies between countries’ own internal growth numbers and changes in the international PPP comparisons. And they lead to general uncertainty about how much we should trust PPP numbers. When I cite PPP comparisons, someone often pops up in the comment section or the X replies to say “PPP is garbage!”. That’s wrong — PPP is not garbage, it’s just hard to measure. But when you’re comparing individual living standards — that is, per capita GDP — there’s really just no alternative. How much actual stuff a person in China or America or France can afford depends much more on local prices than on exchange rates, so if you want to know how rich people in these countries really are, you have no choice but to use something like PPP. When it comes to comparing national power and importance, though, it’s not clear PPP is the right measure either. The cheapness of haircuts isn’t necessarily an important factor in the rise and fall of great powers. But lots of things that are purchased domestically rather than traded on world markets are very important for national power — for example, the salaries of soldiers, locally sourced armaments, local logistics costs, and so on. So if you want to look at military strength, you can’t really use market exchange rates either. For this reason, some people try to construct a “military PPP” that takes explicitly military expenditures into account. These numbers show, for example, that China’s military spending is much closer to America’s in size than official dollar numbers reflect. But national power is probably determined by things other than armies alone — for example, lots of civilian consumer manufacturing could be converted to military uses in the event of a major war, as it was in America and many other countries in World War 2. So if you want to know about military capacity, you can’t just look at defense spending — you have to include all the dual-use stuff as well. Earlier this year, Han Feizi used this sort of comparison to argue that China’s economy is already much bigger than America’s: China’s PPP GDP is only 25% larger than that of the US? Come on people… who are we kidding? Last year, China generated twice as much electricity as the US, produced 12.6 times as much steel and 22 times as much cement. China’s shipyards accounted for over 50% of the world’s output while US production was negligible. In 2023, China produced 30.2 million vehicles, almost three times more than the 10.6 million made in the US…On the demand side, 26 million vehicles were sold in China last year, 68% more than the 15.5 million sold in the US. Chinese consumers bought 434 million smartphones, three times the 144 million sold in the US. As a country, China consumes twice as much meat and eight times as much seafood as the US. A recent post by the blogger “Austrian China” makes a number of other such comparisons — all of which are in China’s favor. The argument here — that expensive services don’t represent true economic output, and that comparisons should look mainly at physical goods — is pretty bad when it comes to measuring living standards. Housing, medical care, child care, and other services are incredibly important determinants of how pleasant a life citizens of various countries lead, and to just leave these out of international comparisons and focus only on electricity and cars and ships makes little sense. But if you’re comparing national power, this sort of argument might make a lot of sense. Nice housing, quality medical care, or high-quality insurance services won’t help you much when a foreign empire’s bombs are raining down on your cities and foreign missiles are sending your country’s fleet to the bottom of the sea. Fundamentally, this is why I think Americans should take little comfort in the fact that their total GDP at market exchange rates is outpacing China’s. With the world looking more dangerous and warlike by the day, manufacturing is a competition that the U.S. and its allies can ill afford to lose: Yes, China boosters like Han Feizi and “Austrians” who care only about physical goods are overconfident about the supremacy of the world’s sole manufacturing superpower. But in my judgement, taking comfort in America’s higher nominal GDP numbers is even more dangerously complacent. Share"

    "text": "[Economics](https://www.ie.edu/insights/subjects/economics/)[China](https://www.ie.edu/insights/areas/china/)\n\n**By:** [Ignacio de la Torre](https://es.linkedin.com/in/idelatorrem/en)\n\nReassessing China’s purported GDP dominance over the US reveals nuanced challenges, reshaping the economic powerhouse narrative, writes Ignacio de la Torre.\n\n![](https://www.ie.edu/insights/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/De-La-mTorre-Feature.jpg)\n\n#### Listen to this Article\n\nAs I reflect on the general consensus that China is growing faster than the United States and that its economy is set to outstrip that of the United States in terms of current GDP, I am reminded of Francis Bacon who, in his _Novum Organum_ – one of the key treatises in the development of the scientific method in the 17th century – wrote: “For what a man had rather were true he more readily believes.”\n\nBy the end of the third quarter 2023, the Chinese economy had grown nominally by 3.5%, and the US economy by 6.4%. Although nominal growth is sometimes overlooked (higher inflation means higher nominal growth), it is taken into account when comparing the size of two economies in dollars. Many analysts have been predicting that the Chinese economy would outperform the US economy in terms of nominal GDP for a number of years. Since this has not happened, and the gap is starting to widen, they often respond by delaying the year of the famous “convergence.”\n\nIn reality, it may not happen at all. In the end, a country’s nominal growth depends on three factors: a) hours worked, b) productivity per hour worked, and c) the GDP price deflator, which largely coincides with the path of inflation. The number of hours worked depends on how many young people enter the labor market versus how many older people retire and is adjusted mainly due to labor force immigration. Productivity depends on the growth of the capital stock and the ability to produce more with existing means, a factor known as “total factor productivity.” Inflation depends on the relationship between the supply and demand for goods and services. The first factor has a negative contribution in China and a positive contribution in the USA, due to the evolution of demographics and net immigration, generating a difference in the variation of hours worked in favor of the United States of approximately 0.5%. From 2030 onwards, the differential will be closer to 1% (as the active population is set to grow marginally in the USA and will begin to fall by 1% a year in China).\n\nThe second factor – productivity growth – benefits China more than the United States (it was around 1.5% in China over the period 2000-19), as it is easier to grow productivity from poor performance levels than from high levels. However, Chinese productivity is increasing less and less, which can be explained by the fact that China is an over-invested economy (which will lead to lower future capital stock growth), as well as by the fact that the public sector is progressively displacing the private sector (the former is less productive than the latter) in the economy, and by the collapse in the flow of foreign direct investment, which negatively affects productivity. These dynamics are gradually narrowing the productivity growth difference between the two countries.\n\nFinally, the United States is facing declining but structural inflation whilst China is on the receiving end of deflationary pressures. Thus, while US inflation stands at 3.1%, China is experiencing price falls of 0.5%. In other words, a spread of 3.6% in favor of the USA.\n\nThe sum of the three figures explains why the US economy is growing more than China’s. The upshot is that the US economy’s share of world GDP has risen, widening the gap with the Asian country, contrary to all forecasts.\n\n> Nominal growth in the United States will exceed that of China.\n\nIt has been argued that it is better to analyze data with purchasing power parity (PPP) when comparing economies. This is true if one is trying to measure the standard of living of an inhabitant, but its usefulness is debatable if one is analyzing a country’s aggregate production. If country A produces ten loaves of bread and has ten inhabitants, and country B produces seven loaves of bread and has 40 inhabitants, when the cost of a loaf of bread is half in relative terms in country B versus A, one can adjust this factor in GDP per capita to understand the standard of living of a citizen since, in relative terms, although the inhabitants of the second country will be worse off than those of the first, the reality is that the standard of living will not be as poor as the division between production and inhabitants, though this will have to be nuanced by the relative cost of goods and services in each country. However, in absolute terms, the first country produces ten loaves, the other seven. If each loaf of bread is worth two dollars, one country produces 20 dollars and the other 14. As of today, the US economy produces about 25 trillion dollars, whilst the Chinese economy stands at 18 trillion dollars.\n\nIf we look at real growth (net of inflation), annualized real growth in the third quarter was close to 5% in both economies. It is true that the US economy has been driven by cyclical factors, above all by consumption led by fiscal stimuli for households of close to 7% of GDP that were applied during the pandemic. It is also true to say that, as China has started from a much lower GDP per capita base, it will find it easier to grow more than the United States for a few years in real terms. However, the actual spread has narrowed, and if inflation data is taken into account, nominal growth in the United States ends up being higher than in China, a trend that is likely to continue in the future. China may experience a period of deflation or disinflation due to its real estate crisis, which could lead to a financial meltdown, in which case its real growth would be significantly lower than the consensus forecast. In theory, the currency of a country experiencing lower inflation than that of a country with higher inflation should appreciate. However, there is downward pressure on the Chinese currency rather than upward, due to much more complex factors.\n\nThis forecast, together with the narrowing of the productivity differential and the favorable spread for the United States in terms of demographics, once again highlights what is relevant: nominal growth in the United States will exceed that of China, which is why it will continue to be the world’s leading economy.\n\nAs the Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard said, “life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards.”\n\nPlace your bets.\n\n© IE

Meanwhile, China's economy showed signs of recovery in several sectors, though some of this had tapered off by March.\n\nThe economic landscapes of both countries have diverged since the end of the pandemic. The U.S.'s has shown resilience, driven by consumer spending and a robust job market. China's has been weighed down by a property-sector crisis, faltering foreign investment and tepid consumer confidence, complicating its trajectory.\n\nThe U.S. economy grew faster than expected last year on the back of a hardy job market and strong consumer spending, with a real GDP growth rate of 2.5 percent.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, however, the economy expanded by just 1.6 percent year over year, down from 3.4 percent in October-December 2023 and less than the 2.4 percent predicted by Wall Street.\n\nThe figure marks the slowest growth rate in two years amid rising inflation and declining public and government spending.\n\n\"The economy will likely decelerate further in the following quarters as consumers are likely near the end of their spending splurge,\" Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, told CNBC.\n\nWhile inflation is driving down savings rates and increasing pressure on consumers, Roach expects it will let up later this year as demand slows overall.\n\nA strong job market continues to buttress the economy. The Department of Labor reported an unemployment figure of 3.8 percent, staying within the 3.7 percent to 3.9 percent range since August.\n\nRead more China news\n\n- [China harbors Russian North Korea arms ship, images show](https://www.newsweek.com/china-accused-harboring-cargo-ship-north-korean-arms-russia-1894469)\n- [Biden signs foreign aid bill—how many US troops are in Taiwan?](https://www.newsweek.com/biden-signs-foreign-aid-bill-including-aid-taiwan-1894283)\n- [US sends Antony Blinken to China amid geopolitical tensions](https://www.newsweek.com/us-sends-antony-blinken-china-amid-geopolitical-tensions-1894189)\n- [NATO members \"chasing shadows\" with spying cases, China says](https://www.newsweek.com/china-says-nato-members-chasing-shadows-spying-cases-1894022)\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects the U.S. will finish strong with a 2.7 percent GDP annual growth but predicts the unemployment rate will tick upward to 4 percent for 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, China, the world's second-largest economy, [posted 5.3 percent](https://www.newsweek.com/china-economy-faces-choppy-waters-1891269) annualized growth for the January-March period, up slightly over last quarter and 0.6 percent higher than analysts predicted in a Reuters poll.\n\nThis first-quarter showing comes after the country's National Statistics Bureau said the economy expanded by 5.2 percent in 2023, meeting its target of \"around 5 percent\"—a target set again for this year by China's cabinet-like State Council.\n\n![How China’s Economy Compares to the US ](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2384204/how-chinas-economy-compares-us.png?w=1200&f=e5cd9eeb014f1e1398108a065f49a5ec)\n\nThe GDP growth China reported for 2023 beat expectations. However, systemic challenges remain, and some economists question whether the world's second-largest economy will ever catch up to the U.S.The GDP growth China reported for 2023 beat expectations. However, systemic challenges remain, and some economists question whether the world's second-largest economy will ever catch up to the U.S.Photo-illustration by Newsweek/Getty\n\nHowever, a closer look at the Q1 data shows that expansion in several sectors, such as exports, took place mainly in the first two months. This has [raised questions](https://www.newsweek.com/china-economy-3-charts-1891737) over the resilience of China's belated post-pandemic recovery.\n\nChina's jobless rate for the first quarter averaged 5.2 percent, continuing along the trend of between 5 percent and 5.3 percent since early last year.\n\n[China](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china) calculates its quarterly unemployment averages as a percentage of jobless people relative to the sum of the unemployed and employed segments of the population. Notably, the government excludes those living in rural areas, which comprise about one-third of the population, from its reports.\n\nThe IMF expects that China will fall short of goal and see its economy expand by just 4.6 percent this year, with an overall 5.1 percent unemployment rate.\n\nMany subject-matter experts, including China's former No. 2, [Li Keqiang](https://www.newsweek.com/china-likeqiang-taiwan-death-leadership-xi-1841055), have expressed doubt over the reliability of China's growth numbers.\n\nAsked whether China's cooling economy can still overtake the U.S. in the coming years, University of Oxford China Centre economist George Magnus told _Newsweek_ that since 2020, the gap between the U.S. and Chinese GDPs has widened from about $5 trillion to $10 trillion in nominal terms.\n\n\"This as U.S. nominal GDP has grown at a compound rate of about 6.75 percent and China's at 6 percent. If this keeps going, China will never catch up the U.S.,\" he said.\n\nNominal GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced in an economy at current market prices, without adjusting for inflation.\n\nAmid persisting economic headwinds in China, including deflation, the window in which it might catch up with the U.S. is closing.\n\n\"There's now a rising chance, I'd say, that the great crossover will not happen at all,\" Magnus said.\n\nSeveral industries in which China is a world leader grew significantly last quarter, however. Production of electric vehicle charging stations shot up by 41.7 percent, for example, and [electrical components](https://www.newsweek.com/chinese-banks-hit-russian-war-economy-1889812) by 39.5 percent.\n\n\"Beijing is banking that 'new productive forces' will take over from property and infrastructure in driving higher GDP growth. I think this is a pipedream,\" Magnus said. \"Islands of technological excellence in a sea of macro-economic troubles is more like it.\"\n\nData from top financial institutions like the [World Bank](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/world-bank) show the gap between the two largest economies [widened further last year](https://www.newsweek.com/china-economy-falling-against-us-dollar-2024-1863428). China's economy was just two-thirds the size of its geopolitical rival, down from 70 percent in 2022 and 76 percent in 2021.\n\n_Newsweek_ reached out to the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. with a written request for comment.\n\n## Uncommon Knowledge\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n\n![](https://g.newsweek.com/www/images/NW_ICON_CommonGround.svg)\n\n## fairness meter\n\n## fairness meter\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nClick On Meter\n\nTo Rate This Article\n\nConfirm your selection\n\n[Comment about your rating](https://www.newsweek.com/china-us-economies-compared-1894756)\n\nShare your rating\n\n[Request Reprint & Licensing](https://www.newsweek.com/contact) [Submit Correction](https://www.newsweek.com/china-us-economies-compared-1894756) [View Editorial Guidelines](https://www.newsweek.com/editorial-guidelines)\n\n### About the writer\n\n[Micah McCartney](https://www.newsweek.com/authors/micah-mccartney)\n\n[FOLLOW](https://www.newsweek.com/authors/micah-mccartney)\n\nMicah McCartney is a reporter for Newsweek based in Taipei, Taiwan.

    "text": "# China’s current economy vs. USA. Which numbers would you prefer for your country?\n\nApril 22, 2024 [admin](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/author/admin/)\n\n[0 Comment](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/chinas-current-economy-vs-usa-which-numbers-would-you-prefer-for-your-country/#respond)\n\n[China Writers' Group](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/)\n\n1\\. GDP Growth\n\nChina\n\n![](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-3.png)\n\n**USA**\n\n![](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png)\n\n![](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/China-GDP-1980-2020.png)\n\nChina GDP growth in US$ Purchasing Power Parities (PPP) 1993-2023\n\nChina Writers’ Group member Godfree Roberts ( [https://herecomeschina.substack.com/](https://herecomeschina.substack.com/))\n\n![](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/China-annual-GDP-growth-1993-2023-in-US.png)\n\n_Note: starting 2024, China’s GDP growth in exchange rate terms is 5.3% per annum, vs. 2.9% for the USA. As the first bar graph shows, this trend has accelerated in the last 10 year. In Purchasing Power Parity terms, the only accurate way to compare apples to apples, the difference is much greater. This is seen in the second bar graph, expressed in annual growth._\n\n2\\. Inflation\n\n![](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-5.png)![](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-6.png)\n\n_Note: China has had deflation recently, which is great for consumers, but over time is unhealthy for the economy, as it puts a break on the manufacturing and service sectors. Notice the graph scales for China and the US. China’s is only 1% and America’s is 5%. For 2024, China’s inflation averages close to zero, so its 5.3% GDP growth nets exactly that. The US’s inflation averages about 3.2%. Against 2.9% GDP growth, America’s net growth is negative 0.3%._\n\n3\\. Consumer spending\n\n![](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/China-savings-rate-2023-v-eu-usa.webp)\n\n_Note: China’s savings rate is almost 10 times higher than the US’s and 2.4 times more than Europe. This is an indication of disposable income, which the Chinese have, Europeans have a little and Americans almost none. More than 85% of Chinese own their home and 2/3 of those own them free and clear, far more than the West, so they are not saddled with rent/mortgage payments every month, which makes a big difference. Ten years ago, China’s savings rate was about 45%, so they are spending more._\n\n![](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/China-air-travel-by-region-2022-2024.png)\n\n_Note: after cratering during the global Covid lockdowns, Chinese travel is rebounding to earlier levels. Many people do not realize that for many years, China has been the #1 outbound and #3 inbound tourist country. By the end of 2024, it looks like China will regain its historical position._\n\n![](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/China-travel-and-autos-surging-2024.webp)\n\n_Note: retail sales are rebounding after the plandemic, with travel and electric vehicles being the champions._\n\n![](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/China-auto-sales-by-EV-ICE-2019-2023.webp)\n\n_Note: Just this month for the first time, EVs outsold internal combustion engines (ICE). Thus, in just four years, China’s car market has gone from 5% EV to 50% This kind of rapid market transformation is historic and unprecedented. As I have reported, Western brands are way behind in EV development and will be left holding the bag, unless they catch up. Otherwise, they will miss out on the world’s biggest car market._\n\n[China Brief: Consumers Are Spending Again (Outside of China) \\| McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/cn/our-insights/our-insights/consumers-are-spending-again)\n\n###\n\nShare on Social Media\n\n[x](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/chinas-current-economy-vs-usa-which-numbers-would-you-prefer-for-your-country/&text=China%26%238217%3Bs+current+economy+vs.+USA.+Which+numbers+would+you+prefer+for+your+country%3F)[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/chinas-current-economy-vs-usa-which-numbers-would-you-prefer-for-your-country/)[whatsapp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=China%26%238217%3Bs+current+economy+vs.+USA.+Which+numbers+would+you+prefer+for+your+country%3F%20https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/chinas-current-economy-vs-usa-which-numbers-would-you-prefer-for-your-country/)[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/chinas-current-economy-vs-usa-which-numbers-would-you-prefer-for-your-country/&title=China%26%238217%3Bs+current+economy+vs.+USA.+Which+numbers+would+you+prefer+for+your+country%3F)[tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/chinas-current-economy-vs-usa-which-numbers-would-you-prefer-for-your-country/&name=China%26%238217%3Bs+current+economy+vs.+USA.+Which+numbers+would+you+prefer+for+your+country%3F&description=)[pinterest](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?media=https://seektruthfromfacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/China-GDP-1980-2020.png&url=https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/chinas-current-economy-vs-usa-which-numbers-would-you-prefer-for-your-country/&is_video=false&description=China%26%238217%3Bs+current+economy+vs.+USA.+Which+numbers+would+you+prefer+for+your+country%3F)[telegram](https://t.me/share/url?url=https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/chinas-current-economy-vs-usa-which-numbers-would-you-prefer-for-your-country/&text=China%26%238217%3Bs+current+economy+vs.+USA.+Which+numbers+would+you+prefer+for+your+country%3F)[reddit](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/chinas-current-economy-vs-usa-which-numbers-would-you-prefer-for-your-country/&title=China%26%238217%3Bs+current+economy+vs.+USA.+Which+numbers+would+you+prefer+for+your+country%3F)[email](mailto://https:%2F%2Fseektruthfromfacts.org%2Fcwg%2Fchinas-current-economy-vs-usa-which-numbers-would-you-prefer-for-your-country%2F?subject=China%26%238217%3Bs+current+economy+vs.+USA.+Which+numbers+would+you+prefer+for+your+country%3F&body=https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/chinas-current-economy-vs-usa-which-numbers-would-you-prefer-for-your-country/)\n\n- [China](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/tag/china/)\n- [communism-socialism](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/tag/communism-socialism/)\n- [Communist Party of China](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/tag/communist-party-of-china/)\n- [CPC](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/tag/cpc/)\n- [Economics](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/tag/economics/)\n- [economy](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/tag/economy/)\n- [GDP](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/tag/gdp/)\n- [GDP PPP](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/tag/gdp-ppp/)\n- [inflation](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/tag/inflation/)\n- [travel](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/tag/travel/)\n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/chinas-current-economy-vs-usa-which-numbers-would-you-prefer-for-your-country/\\#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.Required fields are marked \\*\n\nComment \\*\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\nΔ\n\n### RECENT ARTICLES\n\n- [Psst… Don’t tell Uncle Slaughter this, but China has had the world’s #1 economy since 2014!](https://seektruthfromfacts.org/cwg/psst-dont-tell-uncle-slaughter-this-but-china-has-had-the-worlds-1-economy-since-2014/)\n- [Chinese scientists must be patriots and have spiritual support.

For example, I see a lot of people passing around charts [like this one](https://x.com/visegrad24/status/1874164950748586146), claiming to show that [China’s economy](https://asiatimes.com/2024/12/why-chinas-productivity-keeps-slowing-down/) has fallen behind the US’ since 2021:\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456%2Cc_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto%3Agood%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcadb9afb-7a45-4be9-a4b8-947f8cd85e6b_802x649.jpeg?w=780&quality=89&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto%2Cq_auto%3Agood%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcadb9afb-7a45-4be9-a4b8-947f8cd85e6b_802x649.jpeg?quality=89&ssl=1)\n\nHere’s a more detailed version, from Jason Douglas and Ming Li in the WSJ, showing how forecasts of the sizes of the two economies have changed over time:\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456%2Cc_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto%3Agood%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e8ff8ef-8240-49eb-9947-2208b516d469_908x777.jpeg?w=780&quality=89&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto%2Cq_auto%3Agood%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e8ff8ef-8240-49eb-9947-2208b516d469_908x777.jpeg?quality=89&ssl=1) Source: [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-economy-excess-debt-gdp-46c69585)\n\nIn Bloomberg, Hal Brands [cites this data](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-03/america-still-leads-the-world-in-all-the-ways-that-matter?sref=R8NfLgwS) to support his argument that the US is still ahead of China in terms of global power:\n\n> \\[N\\]early everyone thought China would soon overtake the US as the world’s largest economy. But that crossover point is receding ever further into the future, thanks to robust American growth and deepening Chinese stagnation…Over the past half-decade, the overall [gap](https://www.wsj.com/economy/global/u-s-economy-again-leads-the-world-imf-says-39578275) between the US and Chinese economies — as measured by gross domestic product — has been getting larger.\n\nSo if you just look at this data, you might get the impression that China’s economy is falling behind America’s and will fail to catch up in the future. But then if you read the news, you hear that China’s GDP is [growing at a rate of “around 5%”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-31/xi-says-china-s-2024-gdp-growth-expected-to-be-around-5?sref=R8NfLgwS), while the US [grew at only 3.1%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-19/us-gdp-revised-up-to-3-1-on-stronger-consumer-spending-exports) in 2024. That’s a strong year for the US, but it’s not clear how China’s economy could be falling behind America’s if its growth rate is higher!\n\nThe discrepancy here actually has nothing to do with whether or not China’s GDP growth is overstated. Yes, it’s possible that this is the case — for example, [Rhodium Group guesstimates](https://rhg.com/research/after-the-fall-chinas-economy-in-2025/) that China’s actual growth in 2024 was under 3%. But the charts above actually take the Chinese government’s 5% figure at face value. So why do they show China falling behind America?\n\nThe actual reason for the discrepancy is that there are different ways of comparing GDP. The two basic measures are:\n\n1. GDP at market exchange rates, also called “nominal”\n2. GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP), also called “international dollars”, also called “adjusted for differences in the cost of living”\n\nIf you use the first of these measures, you see China’s GDP falling behind America’s, as in the two charts above. But if you use the second measure, you see China’s GDP already ahead of America’s, and pulling farther ahead every year (albeit at a slower rate than before 2021):\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456%2Cc_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto%3Agood%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63d28bf9-149e-4f9c-a113-50e362ce0b43_1020x734.jpeg?w=780&quality=89&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto%2Cq_auto%3Agood%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63d28bf9-149e-4f9c-a113-50e362ce0b43_1020x734.jpeg?quality=89&ssl=1)\n\nYou’ll notice that this chart says “adjusted for…differences in the cost of living between countries”, and “international $.” That means PPP.\n\nMarket exchange rate GDP is measured in US dollars. You just take a country’s GDP numbers (which are measured in its domestic currency), convert that number to dollars using the current exchange rate, and that’s the country’s “nominal” GDP.\n\nThat’s pretty easy to calculate and measure. But it means that when exchange rates shift, it makes it look like the relative sizes of different economies also shift, even if they all produce the exact same amount of stuff as before. In this case, it turns out that China’s currency (the yuan or RMB) has been depreciating against the US dollar for years.\n\nHere’s a chart of how many dollars one Chinese yuan can buy:\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456%2Cc_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto%3Agood%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ba9d081-8db3-4b10-aaaa-118cc99b9cf0_1350x575.jpeg?w=780&quality=89&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto%2Cq_auto%3Agood%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ba9d081-8db3-4b10-aaaa-118cc99b9cf0_1350x575.jpeg?quality=89&ssl=1) Source: [Xe.com](https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=CNY&to=USD&view=10Y)\n\nYou’ll notice that the yuan was a little bit strong in early 2021 but that in late 2021, its value fell a lot. That’s a big part of the reason that China’s nominal GDP fell relative to America’s over the last three years. The slowdown in China’s official real growth rate was part of the drop, but much of it was just an effect of the cheaper yuan.\n\nIn fact, the forecasts that show China failing to catch up to America over the next 15 years are almost certainly assuming that the yuan stays cheap. If the yuan appreciates, China’s nominal GDP will suddenly look like it jumped up.\n\nIn fact, if China lets the yuan rise a lot, it will look like China’s economy suddenly overtook America’s in size — this is what happened in the late 1980s when Japan allowed its yen to appreciate, and Japan’s nominal GDP suddenly [looked like it was almost as big](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-05-08-fi-63836-story.html) as America’s.\n\nWhether market exchange rates are a good way of comparing countries’ GDP is a subject of debate. On one hand, it’s easy to measure, because exchange rates themselves are clear and unambiguous. And if you care about how many imports two different countries can buy, then market exchange rate GDP is obviously the right comparison. When China’s currency gets weaker, it means China can afford fewer imports.\n\nSo if you’re in a third country like South Korea, and you’re asking, “Which is a more important market for my goods, China or America?”, the answer has definitely shifted toward “America” over the last three years. And lo and behold, America recently overtook China as [South Korea’s largest export market](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-01/us-overtakes-china-as-south-korea-s-top-export-market?sref=R8NfLgwS). Market exchange rate GDP might also translate into clout within international economic organizations.\n\nBut on the other hand, market exchange rate GDP comparisons have some serious downsides. First of all, exchange rates can be determined by policy instead of by market fundamentals. China used to peg the yuan to the dollar. Now it uses a “managed float”, in which the exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate within a range determined by the Chinese government. In practice, [this can look sort of like a peg](https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinas-new-currency-peg).\n\nWhat this means is that if China’s government decided to change the range in which it allows the yuan to trade against the dollar, it might be able to suddenly make China’s economy look bigger than America’s in charts like the ones at the top of this post.\n\nAnd if China decides to make its currency cheaper in order to sell more exports to the world, it can do that too. That will make its economy look smaller in nominal terms, but in fact it will improve China’s export competitiveness, so in some ways it means China’s economy is actually stronger.\n\nMore fundamentally, exchange rates don’t affect real living standards. Despite all the headlines about trade deficits and such, most of what Chinese people buy is produced within China, and most of what Americans buy is produced within America.\n\nThis includes rent, medical care, transportation, and so on. That means that the material living standards of Chinese people and Americans will be determined much more by local prices than by international ones.\n\nPPP is an attempt to adjust for differences in local prices. International organizations like the World Bank send out research teams to various countries to look at local prices of things that aren’t sold on international markets — things like rent and medical care. They then assemble these into a price index. Comparing these price indices across countries gives you a PPP conversion factor that they use to compare economies.\n\nIn theory, this gives a better comparison of how much actual stuff different countries produce. But there are many practical problems with this approach.\n\nFirst of all, the teams that the World Bank and other organizations send out to take stock of local prices won’t necessarily get a great sample of those prices. They might look too much at overpriced cities like Shanghai and not enough at small towns. Or they might look at fancy high-quality apples in a boutique grocery store, not realizing that regular apples cost much less.\n\nOn top of that, PPP is often out of date. Prices can change pretty rapidly, while the teams that go out to measure PPP can’t do a thorough survey every year. This can lead to [big sudden revisions](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/opendata/what-do-the-revised-2017-purchasing-power-parities--ppps--mean-f) that change our understanding of the past as well as the present.\n\nAs if that weren’t enough, PPP also has a hard time comparing quality between different countries’ goods and services. A haircut in Japan might just be better than a haircut in America, but the people who do surveys for the World Bank may not realize this. [1](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/how-do-we-measure-whether-chinas?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=35345&post_id=154122842&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7nm2&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-1-154122842)\n\nThat quality difference should make Japan’s GDP (PPP) a little higher relative to America’s, but in practice, the statistics will often miss it. This is especially important when it comes to the quality of big-ticket items like medical care and the housing stock.\n\nFinally, it’s difficult to compare overall prices between countries because people buy different things in different countries. One country’s people might spend more on health care and less on housing than another country’s. Do they do that because health care is more expensive there, or because they just want more medical care in the first place? It’s hard to say.\n\nAll of these measurement issues lead to [big discrepancies](https://x.com/ThomasPHI2/status/1803176004988313736) between countries’ own internal growth numbers and changes in the international PPP comparisons. And they lead to general uncertainty about how much we should trust PPP numbers. When I cite PPP comparisons, someone often pops up in the comment section or the X replies to say “PPP is garbage!”.\n\nThat’s wrong — PPP is _not_ garbage, it’s just hard to measure. But when you’re comparing individual living standards — that is, per capita GDP — there’s really just no alternative. How much actual stuff a person in China or America or France can afford depends much more on local prices than on exchange rates, so if you want to know how rich people in these countries really are, you have no choice but to use something like PPP.\n\nWhen it comes to comparing national power and importance, though, it’s not clear PPP is the right measure either. The cheapness of haircuts isn’t necessarily an important factor in the rise and fall of great powers.\n\nBut lots of things that are purchased domestically rather than traded on world markets are _very_ important for national power — for example, the salaries of soldiers, locally sourced armaments, local logistics costs, and so on. So if you want to look at military strength, you can’t really use market exchange rates either.\n\nFor this reason, some people try to construct a “military PPP” that takes explicitly military expenditures into account. These numbers show, for example, that China’s military spending is [much closer to America’s](https://militaryppp.com/blog/) in size than official dollar numbers reflect.\n\nBut national power is probably determined by things other than armies alone — for example, lots of civilian consumer manufacturing could be converted to military uses in the event of a major war, [as it was in America](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/book-review-freedoms-forge) and many other countries in World War 2. So if you want to know about military capacity, you can’t just look at defense spending — you have to include all the dual-use stuff as well.\n\nEarlier this year, Han Feizi [used this sort of comparison](https://asiatimes.com/2024/06/whats-the-real-size-of-chinas-economy/) to argue that China’s economy is already much bigger than America’s:\n\n> China’s PPP GDP is only 25% larger than that of the US? Come on people… who are we kidding? Last year, China generated twice as much electricity as the US, produced 12.6 times as much steel and 22 times as much cement. China’s shipyards accounted for over 50% of the world’s output while US production was negligible. In 2023, China produced 30.2 million vehicles, almost three times more than the 10.6 million made in the US…On the demand side, 26 million vehicles were sold in China last year, 68% more than the 15.5 million sold in the US. Chinese consumers bought 434 million smartphones, three times the 144 million sold in the US. As a country, China consumes twice as much meat and eight times as much seafood as the US.\n\n[A recent post](https://austrianchina.substack.com/p/chinas-shocking-worldwide-economic) by the blogger “Austrian China” makes a number of other such comparisons — all of which are in China’s favor.\n\n[The argument here](https://x.com/AustrianChina/status/1875011785004396853) — that expensive services don’t represent true economic output, and that comparisons should look mainly at physical goods — is pretty bad when it comes to measuring living standards.\n\nHousing, medical care, child care, and other services are incredibly important determinants of how pleasant a life citizens of various countries lead, and to just leave these out of international comparisons and focus only on electricity and cars and ships makes little sense.\n\nBut if you’re comparing national power, this sort of argument might make a _lot_ of sense. Nice housing, quality medical care, or high-quality insurance services won’t help you much when a foreign empire’s bombs are raining down on your cities and foreign missiles are sending your country’s fleet to the bottom of the sea.\n\nFundamentally, this is why I think Americans should take little comfort in the fact that their total GDP at market exchange rates is outpacing China’s. With the world looking [more dangerous and warlike](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-players-on-the-eve-of-destruction) by the day, manufacturing is a competition that the US and its allies can ill afford to [lose](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/manufacturing-is-a-war-now).\n\nYes, China boosters like Han Feizi and “Austrians” who care only about physical goods are overconfident about the supremacy of the world’s sole manufacturing superpower. But in my judgment, taking comfort in America’s higher nominal GDP numbers is even more dangerously complacent.\n\n**Note:**\n\n_[1](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/how-do-we-measure-whether-chinas?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=35345&post_id=154122842&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7nm2&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#footnote-anchor-1-154122842) I can assure you with reasonable confidence that the researchers at the World Bank are not known for their stylish haircuts._\n\n_This [article](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/how-do-we-measure-whether-chinas?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=35345&post_id=154122842&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=7nm2&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email) was first published on Noah Smith’s Noahpinion Substack and is republished with kind permission.

Download the app for free on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/voronoi-app/id6447905904) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voronoi.organization.app&pli=1) and discover incredible data-driven charts from a variety of trusted sources._\n\nToday, the global balance of power is shaped by many forces, including economic strength, trade, and a country’s defense-industrial base.\n\nWhile the U.S. and China stand as two great powers, their sources of strength vary significantly. America has unrivaled status in capital markets, and its reserve currency status shows little sign of being overtaken anytime soon. Meanwhile, China’s influence in international trade has grown substantially, now being the top trading partner for 120 countries worldwide.\n\nThis graphic compares the U.S. and China across eight key measures of power, based on analysis from Ray Dalio’s [Great Powers Index 2024](https://economicprinciples.org/downloads/DalioRay_Power_Index_Appendix.pdf).\n\n## Methodology: Measuring the Strength of Nations\n\nFor this analysis, Ray Dalio identified eight core pillars that measure a nation’s different types of strength. These eight categories are:\n\n1. Trade\n2. Innovation and Technology\n3. Education\n4. Economic Output\n5. Military\n6. Financial Center\n7. Competitiveness\n8. Reserve Currency Status\n\nScores for these categories were quantified using Z-scores, which tells you how far a data point is from the average of the dataset, using the typical amount of variation (a standard deviation) in the data as a measuring stick:\n\n- Z-score of 0 = data point is at the average\n- Z-score of 1 = data point is one standard deviation above the average\n\n## Is the U.S. or China More Powerful?\n\nBelow, we show how the U.S. and China measure across each metric of country power in 2024, along with their overall strength score which sees the U.S. (0.89 overall strength score) beat out China (0.80 overall strength score):\n\n| Key Eight Measures of Power | 🇺🇸 U.S. Score | 🇨🇳 China Score |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Education | 2.0 | 1.6 |\n| Innovation and Technology | 1.9 | 1.8 |\n| Competitiveness | -0.4 | 1.0 |\n| Military | 2.1 | 0.9 |\n| Trade | 1.3 | 1.7 |\n| Economic Output | 1.7 | 1.6 |\n| Financial Center | 2.7 | 0.2 |\n| Reserve Currency Status | 1.9 | -0.6 |\n| Overall Strength Score | 0.89 | 0.80 |\n\nAs we can see, both countries are closely matched across certain metrics like innovation and technology along with economic output, while also featuring wide differences in categories like reserve currency status and overall competitiveness.\n\nWhen looking at **tech and innovation**, America is home to the world’s largest tech companies driving AI advancements, China is quickly developing much of the intellectual property in new industries such as semiconductors, electric vehicles, and advanced manufacturing.\n\nIn terms of **economic output and strength**, the gap between America and China’s GDP stands at about $10 trillion. [China could overtake](https://www.cfr.org/blog/tipped-power-balance-chinas-peak-and-us-resilience) America’s economy by 2035 assuming 5% in annual GDP growth, however, Ray Dalio’s own [estimates](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/real-gdp-growth-projections-over-10-years/) of 10-year real GDP growth have China at 4% annual growth. The country’s fragile property sector and weak consumer demand are its biggest obstacles for its future growth prospects.\n\nComparing **education**, while America’s [stagnating](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/10/new-numbers-show-falling-standards-in-american-high-schools?fsrc=core-app-economist) high-school educational system is a source of concern, its [top-ranking universities](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/charted-the-worlds-top-100-universities-by-country/) play a key role in its education score. Meanwhile, China is home to 100 elite universities, although it too has an unequal education system that disproportionately impacts lower-income households.\n\nWhen it comes to **military** power, the U.S. has long being a global leader in defense spending, outpacing China by more than [twofold](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-largest-military-budgets-2022/) as of 2022. Yet, this position is deteriorating. Today, China’s military modernization means that its defense capabilities are neck and neck with America, and perhaps even greater than the U.S. according to sources like the [Global Firepower Index](https://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.php?country1=united-states-of-america&country2=china).\n\nMoreover, China is increasingly growing alliances with Russia, Iran, and North Korea through arms transfers and battlefield exercises, posing a greater risk to America’s military dominance.\n\n## Learn More on the Voronoi App

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link._\n\nNew YorkCNN\n—\n\nThe US economy is growing faster than Wall Street expected, markets are soaring and inflation is approaching the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. It appears that a soft landing, where price rises are tamed and the economy manages to avoid recession, is possible.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s economy [appears to be in distress](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/economy/china-population-gdp-decline-2023/index.html). Markets are [mired in a protracted slump](https://cnn.com/2024/01/26/investing/china-stock-market-slump-challenges-intl-hnk/index.html), consumer confidence is weakening, growth is easing and the population is shrinking. A court has just ordered the [winding up of Evergrande](https://cnn.com/2024/01/29/business/evergrande-ordered-to-liquidate-intl-hnk/index.html), with unpredictable consequences for China’s real estate crisis.\n\nSo what does that mean for relations between the first- and second-largest economies in the world?\n\nBefore the Bell spoke with Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and former head of the International Monetary Fund’s China division.\n\nThe interview was conducted over email. It has been edited for clarity.\n\n_Before the Bell: Is it fair to say that the US is outpacing China in the race for economic supremacy?_\n\n_Eswar Prasad:_ The US has solidified its position as the main driver of global growth, which is all the more striking as the rest of the world is struggling to maintain decent growth.\n\n_Just last year people might have said the opposite — that the US was heading towards recession and the Chinese economy was thriving. What changed?_\n\nIt is remarkable to see the US economy blazing ahead while the Chinese economy sputters and slips into deflation. This difference is mainly due to the innate resilience of the US economy while China continues to be held back by a number of short-term and long-term problems. These problems include a declining labor force, a property market that is unraveling, and a loss of household and business confidence in the government’s policies.\n\nThe strong performance of the US economy and falling growth in China together make it less obvious that China’s economy will someday overtake that of the US in terms of annual GDP, a proposition that was once considered a near certainty.\n\n_How does this factor in to rising tensions between the US and China?_\n\nChina’s weak economy and uncertain growth prospects are no doubt making the Chinese government more eager to reduce trade tensions with the US, since those tensions are adding to already uncertain growth prospects and hurting business confidence.\n\nBoth the US and Chinese governments do seem eager to prevent any further escalation of trade hostilities, particularly since rhetoric against China is going to get more heated in the US as the election season draws near.\n\n_What else should investors be aware of when they read about the Chinese economy?_\n\nReflecting its concerns about the weak economy and falling stock prices, the Chinese government has increased government spending, cut interest rates and taken measures to prop up the property and stock markets.\n\nThese measures are having limited effect since they haven’t by themselves done much to solve the fundamental problem of weak household and business confidence, which is holding back household consumption and private investment.\n\n## JPMorgan Chase’s succession plan\n\nJamie Dimon is one of the most well-known and closely listened to CEOs in the world. Over the course of his tenure at JPMorgan Chase, he’s become somewhat synonymous with the largest US bank by assets.\n\nBut Dimon can’t lead forever, and as he approaches his 68th birthday, the question of succession has grown more important.\n\nThis week, JPMorgan announced that it’s shaking up its top brass, perhaps in a bid to find an answer to that pressing question: Who comes next?\n\nThe bank has appointed Marianne Lake as the sole CEO of the consumer division, an area previously run by both Lake and Jennifer Piepszak, according to a [filing](https://jpmorganchaseco.gcs-web.com/node/619456/html) on Thursday.\n\nPiepszak, meanwhile, will lead the company’s newly combined commercial and investment bank with her co-CEO Troy Rohrbaugh. Rohrbaugh is the former head of trading and securities services for the bank.\n\nDimon has made it clear that he’s happy in his current role for now, and why wouldn’t he be? Dimon has built a banking empire at JPMorgan Chase, and his advice is sought by [presidents](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/business/dimon-energy-biden-russia-ukraine/index.html), prime ministers and central bankers.\n\nStill, he hasn’t entirely ruled out a future in politics. Last spring [he told Bloomberg](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/31/economy/jamie-dimon-politics/index.html), “I love my country, and maybe one day I’ll serve my country in one capacity or another.”\n\n## The NSA buys Americans’ internet data, newly released documents show\n\nIt’s no secret that advertisers love to track what we do online. But a disturbing new revelation shows that our search history travels further than we think.\n\nThe National Security Agency has been buying Americans’ web browsing data from commercial data brokers without warrants, intelligence officials disclosed in documents made public by a US senator Thursday, [reports my colleague](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/tech/the-nsa-buys-americans-internet-data-newly-released-documents-show/index.html?utm_source=business_ribbon) Brian Fung.\n\nThe purchases include information about the websites Americans visit and the apps that they use, said Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, releasing [newly unclassified letters](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/signed_wyden_letter_to_dni_re_nsa_purchase_of_domestic_metadata_and_ftc_order_on_data_brokers_with_attachments.pdf) he received from the Pentagon in recent weeks confirming the sales.\n\nThe disclosures are the latest evidence that government agencies routinely buy sensitive information about Americans from commercial marketplaces that they would otherwise be required to obtain via court order.\n\nAnd it comes amid rising concerns that foreign governments are doing the same; CNN reported earlier this week that the Biden administration is [preparing an executive order](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/biden-administration-foreign-governments-exploiting-personal-data/index.html) meant to curb foreign purchases of US citizens’ personal data.\n\n[Read more here.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/tech/the-nsa-buys-americans-internet-data-newly-released-documents-show/index.html?utm_source=business_ribbon)\n\nRelated\n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n\n### CNN Business Videos\n\n[![still_20691667_2446392.798_still.jpg](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-20691667-2446392-798-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill)\\\n\\\nCNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/video/spacex-elon-musk-lawsuit-paige-holland-thielen-digvid) [VideoFormer employee suing SpaceX and Elon Musk tells CNN what it was like working at company3:04\\\n\\\nJun 13, 2024](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/video/spacex-elon-musk-lawsuit-paige-holland-thielen-digvid)\n\n[![ Imagine having the power to answer a call with just one look.
