    "text": "\n Co-authored with Professor Michael Krassa, University of Illinois-Urbana. \n The Question \n What’s better at creating happiness —the government or the free market? \n Conservatives believe that market forces should guide our political and economic lives. They think that only truly free, which is to say, basically unregulated, markets can create a flourishing economy or maintain individual liberty—hence, their opposition to things like the minimum wage (which interferes with the labor market) or Obamacare (which interferes with the health insurance market). \n Liberals believe in markets too, but only up to a point. They stress that we need countervailing institutions that mix what they think of as equity and justice with market principles—for instance, the better living that a higher minimum wage implies or the guarantee of access to health insurance that Obamacare promises. \n There is much to be said in abstract theory for both approaches, but the evidence is hard to judge. Research clearly suggests that the minimum wage, for instance, almost certainly does, as conservatives insist, cost some jobs, but it also simultaneously does work, as liberals maintain, to reduce poverty and generally increase living standards for millions of families (for a discussion of the minimum wage and happiness, see t his post by fellow PT blogger Michael Ungar). \n The only way to decide how these forces balance each other is to adopt a single metric (a common scale) by which comparison is possible. We propose the overall level of human happiness as such a metric. This approach allows us to determine whether progressive or conservative policies are best, in so far as we accept human happiness as the appropriate metric. \n As political scientists, we have spent years examining how these different approaches to public policy affect the quality of human life. After all, the Declaration of Independence itself promises us the right to “the pursuit of happiness.” How to best help people find happiness is thus a question at the very root of American politics. Again, then, do progressive or conservative policies best promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number? \n Left/Right differences in economic philosophy will of course (immigration aside) be the central axis of political conflict in the upcoming presidential election. Essentially all of the Republican candidates are decidedly pro-market, in the sense of being opposed to the emblematic public policies (the minimum wage, Obamacare) noted above. Conversely, all of the Democratic contenders are (in varying degrees) more skeptical of leaving the market to solve problems, and thus favor those same policies. \n It is easy to understand the differences between pro-market conservatives and more pro-regulation progressives. Conservatives believe that if just leave it alone, the market will generally see to greater well-being for all, in a spontaneous, natural, and above, all “efficient,” fashion. In this view, our attempts to meddle with the market just end up creating new and worse problems, often at great public expense. Progressives, on the other hand, believe that we have to recognize the limitations of markets, which they believe are painfully obvious in the contemporary world. They want to regulate markets so as to produce not “efficient” outcomes, but “just” ones. Accordingly, they are more inclined to use government to protect the interests of consumers, workers, and the environment even if doing so may violate pure free market principles. \n The Evidence \n The United Nations, preparing its “World Happiness Report,” surveys the happiness across the world. The U.N. asks, among other things, how people rate their lives on a scale from the “best possible” to “worst possible.” They report that the most important factors for happiness are social support, income security, and health. Of these, the latter two can be most directly influenced by governmental policy. \n Consider for instance the chart below. It shows how the minimum wage—perhaps the most important and easiest to understand direct regulatory interventions in the labor market—affects overall levels of satisfaction with life. As is apparent, satisfaction increases as the minimum wage increases. \n \n \n Source: Michael Krassa/The Conversation \n \n While these results are only illustrative, more sophisticated peer reviewed academic research strongly supports the general contention that pro-worker labor market regulations, such as the minimum wage, produce greater levels of happiness, controlling for other factors. This work has appeared in academic journals such as Politics and Policy and the Journal of Politics, as well as in Radcliff’s book The Political Economy of Human Happiness (Cambridge University Press). \n If we extend the idea of regulation to include things like laws that protect the right of workers to form labor unions, or simply the extent to which society provides a social safety net for those who fall through the cracks in the market through no fault of their own, there is even more, and still more conclusive, evidence that these kind of nominally anti-market policies dramatically improve quality of life. I have summarized the peer reviewed scholarly evidence on these and related points in two prior posts, one focusing on public policy in countries like Denmark, and another considering the United States per se. \n While there are surely some negative economic consequences of regulation—conservatives are doubtless sometimes right when making this argument—the research noted above clearly demonstrates that the total, net human impact of these policies is positive. It is important to note too that this “happiness benefit” applies to everyone in society: the affluent and the poor, men and women, liberals and conservatives. The reason is simple: everyone benefits from shared prosperity, in that such reduces the harm to society that poverty and gross inequality perpetuate. \n The evidence is clear: pro-worker “interventions” in the market benefit society writ large. As is apparent with the effects of the minimum wage, citizens are happier when they know that the minimum payoff for hard work is enough for a decent living. \n The real question, we would argue, is whether our public policies should serve the interests of our citizens or those of the market. \n You can find the full-text of both of the peer reviewed articles discussed in this post (among others) and read a chapter from The Political Economy of Human Happiness here. \n twitter: \n Professor Michael Krassa: @ProfKrassa \n Professor Benajmin Radcliff: @Radcliff_Ben \n A rather different version of this article first appeared at The Conversation. \n ||||I||||Skip to main content\n Mobile Navigation\n Psychology Today\n * Find a Therapist\n Find a Therapist\n Therapists\n + Therapists\n + Treatment Centers\n + Support Groups\n x\n Therapists : Login | Sign Up\n International\n + Australia\n + Austria\n + Belgium\n + Canada\n + Denmark\n + Hong Kong\n + Ireland\n + New Zealand\n + Singapore\n + South Africa\n + Sweden\n + Switzerland\n + United Kingdom\n + United States\n * Get Help\n Mental Health\n + Addiction\n + Anxiety\n + ADHD\n + Asperger's\n + Autism\n + Bipolar Disorder\n + Chronic Pain\n + Depression\n + Eating Disorders\n Personality\n + Passive Aggression\n + Personality\n + Shyness\n Personal Growth\n + Goal Setting\n + Happiness\n + Positive Psychology\n + Stopping Smoking\n Relationships\n + Low Sexual Desire\n + Relationships\n + Sex\n Family Life\n + Child Development\n + Parenting\n View Help Index\n Do I Need Help?\n + Self Tests\n + Therapy Center\n NEW\n Recently Diagnosed?\n + Diagnosis Dictionary\n + Types of Therapy\n Talk to Someone\n + Find a Therapist\n + Find a Treatment Center\n + Find a Support Group\n * Magazine\n Current\n January 2023\n 5 Ways to Find Purpose\n\n Knowing what you value will help you build the most meaningful life possible.\n\n Subscribe\n Recent\n Issue Archive\n * Today\n\n News\n\n + The Idea of the Mobile Personality Revisited\n + Why Some Tweets Trigger Hate Speech\n + 5 Science-Based Techniques to Learn From Failure\n + When It Comes to Use It or Lose It, What Should You Use?\n Essential Reads\n + How Many Toys Should Your Toddler Have?\n + The Mental Health Impact of Cancer Screening\n + Why the Chinese Spy Scare Could Trigger a Rash of UFO Reports\n + 5 Counterintuitive Ways to Fall Asleep\n Trending Topics\n + Coronavirus Disease 2019\n + Narcissism\n + Dementia\n + Bias\n + Affective Forecasting\n + Neuroscience\n\n See All\n\n intl\n Search\n Search\n Search\n\n Verified by Psychology Today\n\n Benjamin Radcliff Ph.D.\n The Economy of Happiness\n\n Do Progressive or Conservative Policies Promote Happiness?\n\n Research suggests that regulating the market is in everyone's interest.\n\n Posted December 11, 2015\n\n * Share\n * Tweet\n * Email\n\n Co-authored with Professor Michael Krassa, University of Illinois-Urbana.\n\n The Question\n\n What’s better at creating happiness—the government or the free market?\n\n Conservatives believe that market forces should guide our political and economic lives.

And suppose that, to my enormous surprise, he announced that every empirical claim advanced by conservatives was correct. Cutting taxes produces such great economic growth that even the poor benefit. Privatizing or eliminating social programs like Medicare and Social Security will cause the elderly to save more money and enjoy higher living standards. Slashing regulations, by eliminating unintended side effects, actually does a better job helping those whom the regulations were intended to help than the regulations themselves. Suppose that God presented these conclusions so convincingly--if his stature alone did not suffice--that everybody immediately accepted them as truth.\n\nHow would liberals respond? No doubt by rethinking and abandoning nearly all their long-held positions. Liberalism, after all, claims to produce certain outcomes: more prosperity and security, especially for the poor and middle classes; a cleaner environment; safer foods and drugs; and so on. If it were proved beyond a doubt that liberal policies fail to produce those outcomes--or even, as conservatives often claim, that such policies hurt their intended beneficiaries--then their rationale would disappear. It may be hard to imagine liberals advocating capital gains tax cuts as a way to lift up the working stiff. But that's just because there's no evidence to show they do. If the evidence were to change, so would the liberal mindset. The point is that liberalism has no justification other than the belief that liberal policies produce beneficial outcomes.\n\nNow imagine the opposite were to happen. God appears in order to affirm liberal precepts: Current tax levels barely affect economic incentives, social programs provide tremendous economic security at modest cost to growth, and most regulations achieve their intended effects without producing undue distortions. Would economic conservatives likewise abandon their views? Some certainly would, but a great many would not. Economic conservatism, unlike liberalism, would survive having all its empirical underpinnings knocked out from beneath it.\n\nAnd not because conservatives are necessarily more stubborn. (Indeed, on an individual level, liberals may well be just as stubborn as conservatives.) Rather, conservatism, unlike liberalism, overlays a deeper set of philosophical principles. Conservatives believe that big government impinges upon freedom. They may also believe that big government imposes large costs on the economy. But, for a true conservative, whatever ends they think smaller government may bring about--greater prosperity, economic mobility for the non-rich--are almost beside the point. As Milton Friedman wrote, \"\\[F\\]reedom in economic arrangements is itself a component of freedom broadly understood, so economic freedom is an end in itself.\"\n\nWe're accustomed to thinking of liberalism and conservatism as parallel ideologies, with conservatives preferring less government and liberals preferring more. The equivalency breaks down, though, when you consider that liberals never claim that increasing the size of government is an end in itself. Liberals only support larger government if they have some reason to believe that it will lead to material improvement in people's lives. Conservatives also want material improvement in people's lives, of course, but proving that their policies can produce such an outcome is a luxury, not a necessity.\n\nThe contrast between economic liberalism and economic conservatism, then, ultimately lies not only in different values or preferences but in different epistemologies. Liberalism is a more deeply pragmatic governing philosophy--more open to change, more receptive to empiricism, and ultimately better at producing policies that improve the human condition--than conservatism.\n\nNow, liberalism's pragmatic superiority wouldn't matter to a true ideological conservative any more than news about the medical benefits of pork (to pick an imaginary example) would cause a strictly observant Jew to begin eating ham sandwiches. But, if you have no particular a priori preference about the size of government and care only about tangible outcomes, then liberalism's aversion to dogma makes it superior as a practical governing philosophy.\n\nConservatives don't always dwell on their first principles because those principles have little use in converting unbelievers. But they pop up from time to time, especially when conservative factual claims come under stress.\n\nTake, for instance, the current debate over privatizing Social Security. Los Angeles Times Editorial Page Editor Michael Kinsley has argued that privatization cannot increase national wealth--an argument that, if true, would undermine the idea's central rationale. A recent National Review editorial implicitly accepted the thrust of Kinsley's argument and proceeded to gamely offer up some possible second- and third-order benefits that privatization could produce. (People might be induced to save a bit more, and maybe higher debt would discourage spending.) Seemingly unpersuaded by its own reasoning, the editorial righted itself by declaring that \"reducing dependence on Washington is a worthy goal in its own right.\"\n\nLikewise, conservative columnist George F. Will conceded not long ago that, contrary to the claims of privatization advocates, Social Security does not face a financing crisis. But Will declared his support for privatization anyway. \"\\[T\\]he best reasons rise from the philosophy of freedom: Voluntary personal accounts will allow competing fund managers, rather than a government monopoly on income transfers from workers to retirees, to allocate a large pool of money.\"\n\nThis preference for removing power from Washington is simply something that either you accept or you don't. It's neither right nor wrong in an absolute sense. It does, however, make empirical reasoning pointless. Viewed pragmatically, Social Security raises questions about which economics has a lot to say: balancing the tradeoffs between retiree incomes and costs to workers, allocating risk, and so on. Liberal thinking, unlike conservative thinking, actually hinges on the outcome of those questions.\n\nThis doesn't mean that conservatives don't believe their own empirical arguments. Nor does it mean that ideologically driven thinking can't lead to empirically sound outcomes. In many cases--conservative opposition to tariffs, price controls, and farm subsidies--it does. But empirical reasoning simply does not drive their thinking. What appears to be conservative economic reasoning is actually a kind of backward reasoning. It begins with the conclusion and marches back through the premises.\n\nConsider the conservative view of health care. Conservatives repeat the mantra that the United States has \"the best health care system in the world\"--a formulation used endlessly by President Bush. That isn't true by almost any objective measure. The United States devotes a far higher share of its economy to health care than any other country. Yet, according to the most recent World Health Organization study, the United States ranks just 37th in overall health care performance. These massive inefficiencies derive in part from our huge numbers of uninsured. The uninsured end up forgoing treatment until they arrive at the emergency room. Basic preventive care, of the sort universally available in every other advanced country, would avert such disasters--at less cost to the economy and with less suffering and fatality for patients.\n\nThe only way to deem the U.S. system the \"best\" is if you substitute ideological criteria for pragmatic criteria. Our health care system is indeed the best at minimizing the role of government. France, on the other hand, produces better measurable health outcomes at a vastly lower cost. Yet conservatives would consider the notion that France has a better health care system than the United States to be self-evidently false.\n\nThe conundrum is that the remedy of smaller government is particularly ill-suited for the problem of health care. The market for medical services does not resemble the market for blue jeans. Among other problems, health insurance firms have every incentive to deny coverage to those most likely to get sick, which makes the individual health insurance market inefficient and prohibitively expensive. Economists call this phenomenon \"adverse selection,\" and it is inherent in the private health care market. It cannot be solved without some kind of government intervention.\n\nFor this reason, conservatives have almost nothing to say about adverse selection. When they do write about the topic, they tend to call for bromides like (to take an example from a David Brooks New York Times Magazine essay last year) \"reforming the health care system so competition works as it does in every other sphere--to improve value, spur innovation and reduce costs.\" This is classic backward reasoning: Start with a solution (competition) and then proceed to make it fit the problem. In this case, the author doesn't even explain how to make the solution fit the problem. He simply assumes that it can be done because market forces work everywhere and always. If liberalism is not the mirror image of conservatism, what is? The more apt parallel is probably socialism. True socialists believe that allowing capitalists to keep some of the fruits of workers' labor is inherently immoral. They also tend to believe that free enterprise does not work very well. But, like the conservative belief that big government doesn't work well, this empirical belief merely sits atop a deeper normative belief. For committed socialists, doing away with \"exploitation\" is an end in itself.\n\nContemporary economic liberalism is less of an ideology than the absence of one--a rejection both of dogmatic fealty and hostility to the free market. Franklin Roosevelt famously called for \"bold, persistent experimentation.\" The New Dealers vacillated wildly between promoting competition and squelching it, fiscal tightening and fiscal loosening, putting people to work and pulling workers out of the labor pool. They were accused, correctly, of incoherence.\n\nBut incoherence is simply the natural byproduct of a philosophy rooted in experimentation and the rejection of ideological certainty. In an open letter to Roosevelt, John Maynard Keynes called him \"the Trustee for those in every country who seek to mend the evils of our condition by reasoned experiment within the framework of the existing social system. If you fail, rational change will be gravely prejudiced throughout the world, leaving orthodoxy and revolution to fight it out.\" Note how Keynes defined his and Roosevelt's shared ideology as \"reasoned experiment\" and \"rational change\" and contrasted it with orthodoxy (meaning the conservative dogma that market economics were self-correcting) and revolution.\n\nThat definition of liberal obviously leaves a very wide berth. It's wide enough, in fact, to encompass every president from FDR until at least Ronald Reagan. At the time, of course, liberals did not consider Republicans like Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon their ideological kin. But, in historical retrospect, that is only because the underlying assumptions of the New Deal were so broadly shared. It was impossible to imagine a president who stood outside that consensus, so all the fights took place within it. While those on the right wing of this ideological consensus were more cautious about government activism than those on the left wing, they did not challenge the underlying assumptions.\n\nEisenhower used the federal government, rather than states and localities, to build the Federal Highway System, and he made no effort to reduce a top tax rate that stood at an absurdly high 91 percent. Nixon declared, \"We are all Keynesians now.\" He raised Social Security benefits and proposed an ambitious national health care plan. Conservatives have since renounced Nixon's economic record, and no wonder. Today it would place him on the left edge of the Democratic Party.\n\nIt's not a coincidence that the two most economically liberal Republican presidents--Nixon and his successor, Gerald Ford--also displayed the most serious interest in empiricism. Both required their assistants to produce detailed \"Brandeis briefs\" outlining the essential arguments on both sides of any policy debate. Ford invited Milton Friedman and John Kenneth Galbraith into the Oval Office for a free-ranging debate on economic policy.\n\nSince the mid-'70s, the GOP has grown steadily more conservative, and therefore less pragmatic. Genuine ideological conservatives, banished to minority status since Eisenhower, briefly resurfaced under Barry Goldwater, and, after falling back again, began to take control of the Republican Party. Conservatives correctly see George W. Bush as one of their own. Bush does frequently depart from conservative orthodoxy, as with his tariffs, farm subsidies, and Medicare drug benefit. Yet conservatives understand that Bush sees these compromises as politically expedient, not a genuinely felt embrace of expansive government. His signature proposals--massive tax cuts and Social Security privatization--both reflect a belief that reducing government is an end in itself. Outside events exert not even the slightest influence on his policy goals. Bush steadfastly embraced his tax cuts as the economy veered from boom and surplus to slowdown to wartime to recovery and deficit.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats have continuously reexamined their policies in light of changing conditions. Bill Clinton came to office planning to spur the economy with a Keynesian stimulus, but abandoned those plans after fierce debate among his staff economists. Instead he embraced the novel goal of sparking recovery by slashing the deficit in the hopes that lower interest rates would enable sustainable growth. As that policy seemed to work, moderate liberals continued to embrace the credo of fiscal restraint. But, after the economy slid toward a recession in 2001, liberal economists abandoned short-term restraint in favor of temporary tax cuts to encourage spending.\n\nClinton also recognized the failure of welfare, previously a cherished liberal goal, to accomplish its stated purpose, and he enacted a sweeping overhaul. Many liberals complained, but the main objections centered around the details--certain punitive provisions and the lack of adequate job-creation measures--not the concept of welfare reform.\n\nThat Clinton's economic policymakers had great use for empirical inquiry, and Bush's do not, is hardly a secret. One way to see the contrast is to compare the economic summits each president has held. Clinton's 1992 Little Rock economic summit featured a vigorous and open-ended debate between diverse participants, and it helped persuade the Clinton team to alter the economic blueprint developed during the campaign. Bush's summits have been tightly scripted affairs in which supporters testify to the virtues of his policies.\n\nOr compare two memoirs: Robert Reich's Locked in the Cabinet and Paul O'Neill's The Price of Loyalty. Both books chronicle the disillusionment of a former Cabinet member. Reich, the former Clinton labor secretary, bemoans the triumph of cautious deficit-cutting over public investment, but his tale is larded with academic policy debates he simply happened to lose. O'Neill, the former Bush Treasury secretary, mourns that administration's hostility to expertise and fact-driven debate. \"You don't have to know anything or search for anything,\" he says of the ideologues in the administration. \"You already know the answer to everything. It's not penetrable by facts. It's absolutism.\"\n\nPart of this difference reflects the cultural predilections of the last two presidents--Bush is the instinctive anti-intellectual who likes to go with his gut, and Clinton is the former Rhodes scholar who relished academic debates. But it also reflects the natural tendencies of conservatism and liberalism. Bush's administration gives primacy to political advisers over policy wonks in large part because they have no need to debate their ends, only the means of achieving them.\n\nThe next liberal administration, whenever it happens, will not be nearly so certain. Aside from rolling back conservative excesses, its economic agenda will take its cue from external events, and the decisions it arrives at could, in time, be cast aside through experimentation. Ultimately, those policies, whether they move left or right, will be measured against their effect on people's lives, not the degree to which they bring the government closer to some long-ago agreed-upon vision. In time, those policies will be altered yet again to suit a changing world. This is known as progress.\n\n_Jonathan Chait is a senior editor at_ The New Republic.\n\nRead More:\n\n[Politics](https://newrepublic.com/tags/politics), [Washington](https://newrepublic.com/tags/washington), [Los Angeles Times Editorial Page](https://newrepublic.com/tags/los-angeles-times-editorial-page), [Brooks New York Times](https://newrepublic.com/tags/brooks-new-york-times), [United States](https://newrepublic.com/tags/united-states), [Bill Clinton](https://newrepublic.com/tags/bill-clinton), [Franklin Roosevelt](https://newrepublic.com/tags/franklin-roosevelt), [Dwight Eisenhower](https://newrepublic.com/tags/dwight-eisenhower), [Michael Kinsley](https://newrepublic.com/tags/michael-kinsley), [George W.

    "text": "# Conservative\n\n## What it Means to be a Conservative\n\n## Overview\n\nThe conservative self-image, from [**Three Languages of Politics**](https://cdn.cato.org/libertarianismdotorg/books/ThreeLanguagesOfPolitics.pdf) by Arnold Kling…\n\nMy heroes are the people who have stood up for the traditional values and institutions that created our civilization. The people I cannot stand are the people who hate and undermine those values and institutions.\n\nConservatives seek to maximize virtue, prudence, and personal responsibility. Conservatives believe that…\n\n- Hard work and thrift can solve most social problems as long as virtue is present\n- Civilization starts to decay when people give vent to their base desires\n- Hard work and thrift are impossible when self-discipline is absent\n- Those who elevate their base desires over virtue inevitably come to hate the values and institutions that contradict their sloth, self-indulgence, and decadence\n- This hatred of values and institutions undermines civilization and pushes humanity back toward barbarism\n- Those professions that risk or sacrifice themselves to defend our values and institutions – such as the police and the military – provide the best models for what we all should be.\n- Those who favor base desires over virtue will naturally tend to look down on these professions. They will likewise sneer at the churches and people of faith who are the main advocates for virtue.\n\nConservatives also realize that state power can be used to undermine the values and institutions that make civilization possible. This is why they favor limitations to protect the freedom of expression and the exercise of religion. They also oppose programs that discourage work and self-responsibility, or that attempt to re-engineer society from the top down. Such efforts are immodest and imprudent. However, some conservatives think that self-expression must be legally limited whenever it threatens to undermine virtue.\n\n## What would things look like in a conservative world?\n\nThe conservative vision seeks to leverage what has worked before to achieve even better results in the future.\n\nThe conservative view does not oppose progress. Rather, it recognizes that innovations fail more often than they succeed. Thus, real progress – especially social progress – comes slowly and at the margins. Civilization does not make leaps. It advances step by careful step.\n\nMore importantly, real progress cannot be predicted, managed, or engineered by politicians and bureaucrats, even if they award themselves the label progressive. Mere labels cannot guarantee improvement. Only virtue can do that.\n\nMore often than not, attempts to force things to be better will actually make things worse. That is why the road to hell is paved with good intentions. It is also why tried and true values and institutions must serve as the foundation upon which innovation and progress are constructed.\n\nIn a conservative world, each year will be slighter better than the one that came before. The conservative focus on virtue will permit simple hard work, thrift, and prudence, to steadily build the wealth we need to solve most social problems. It will be a world of security and stability, prudence and modesty, law and order.\n\n- Poverty can only be solved through wealth creation, and that requires hard work, prudence, and thrift.\n- Substance abuse can only be solved by abstinence, without which hard work is impossible.\n- Ignorance is likewise cured through hard work. This is better achieved through self-discipline than by self-indulgence.\n- Bigotry is best combated by permitting people to disassociate from bigots rather than by allowing the bigots to hide by legally silencing them. People must be allowed to feel the consequences of their own bad actions.\n- Security and peace can only be achieved by being well-prepared for war.\n- And we can best combat crime by honoring the risks police take to protect us.\n\nThus, a conservative world would be one of increased affluence, more sobriety, greater knowledge, sequestered and shamed bigotry, and enduring peace, both at home and abroad.\n\n## Types of conservatives\n\n- **National Conservatives** – Donald Trump, Pat Buchanan\n- **Traditionalist Conservatives** – Mike Pence, Rick Santorum, Tim Scott, Mike Huckabee\n- **Paleo Conservatives** – Ronald Reagan, Robert Taft, and Pat Buchanan have all been described as paleo-conservative\n- **Libertarian Conservatives** – Barry Goldwater, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Milton Friedman, Thomas Sowell\n\n## Important conservative heroes and accomplishments\n\n- **President Ronald Reagan** is revered by conservatives for his commitment to limited government, free markets, traditional values, and a strong national defense. His key achievements include implementing supply-side economics by reducing tax rates, and causing the end of the Cold War through a defense build-up that bankrupted the Soviet Union.\n\n- **Senator Barry Goldwater** was the Republican Party’s 1964 presidential nominee. Conservatives credit him with bringing conservatism to national relevance. His book “The Conscience of a Conservative” was influential in shaping modern conservative thought.\n\n- **Economist Milton Friedman** was a Nobel laureate with libertarian views. He had a strong influence on many conservatives and his ideas on monetary policy, free trade, and deregulation had a significant impact on legislation. He helped create the volunteer military, the earned income tax credit, and the system of free-floating international currency exchange.\n\n- **William F. Buckley, Jr.** was a conservative intellectual, author, and the founder of National Review, which has long been the premier conservative intellectual journal. He played a crucial role in articulating and popularizing conservative principles, emphasizing limited government, free markets, and traditional values. He had a strong libertarian bent reflected in his opposition to many victimless crime laws.\n\n- **U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia** was highly regarded by conservatives for his defense of conservative legal principles, including originalist interpretation, limited judicial activism, and the preservation of individual rights.\n\n- **British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher** rolled back welfare state socialism in the UK, privatized many government businesses with good results, and reduced the overall role of the state in the economy.\n\n- **Thomas Sowell** is a libertarian conservative economist, social theorist, and historian. He has challenged the official narrative on subjects of race, culture, education, history, and the true record of free markets versus state intervention.\n\n- **Edmund Burke** was an Irish member of the British Parliament. Many consider him to be the father of modern conservatism. His writings, such as “Reflections on the Revolution in France,” emphasized the importance of tradition, stability, and gradual change in preserving social order.\n\n- **Russell Kirk** was a prominent conservative intellectual, author, and political theorist. He published his most seminal work, “The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot,” in 1953. He traced the intellectual roots of conservatism and highlighted the importance of tradition, order, and virtue in preserving a healthy society. He emphasized the value of limited government, individual freedom, and the free market, but cautioned against unchecked capitalism and argued that economic efficiency had to be balanced with the moral and social well-being of the community.\n\n## Important conservative organizations\n\n- **The Heritage Foundation** was founded in 1973. It conducts research and promotes conservative policies in areas such as limited government, free markets, individual liberty, traditional values, and a strong national defense.\n\n- **The Federalist Society** was founded in 1982. it promotes a textualist and originalist interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. It provides a forum for conservative legal scholars, lawyers, and judges to discuss constitutional law. It also advocates for the appointment of conservative judges who adhere to the principles of limited government and judicial restraint.\n\n- **The National Rifle Association (NRA)** was founded in 1871. It works to defend the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. It also promotes firearm safety, education, and training.\n\n- **Americans for Tax Reform (ATR)** was founded in 1985. It promotes lower taxes and limited government. ATR is best known for its “Taxpayer Protection Pledge,” which asks politicians to commit to opposing any net tax increase.\n\n- **The Club for Growth** was founded in 1999. It supports pro-market candidates in primary elections, aiming to influence the Republican Party’s direction. The organization promotes pro-growth policies such as tax cuts, deregulation, and entitlement reform, with the goal of advancing economic freedom and prosperity.\n\n- **The Young Americas Foundation (YAF)** was founded in 1969. It is the largest conservative outreach and training organization for young people. It also operates the Young Americans for Freedom chapters on universities.\n\n## Important conservative books\n\n- **_The Conservative Mind_** **by Russell** **Kirk** was published in 1953. It is often regarded as the foundational text for modern American conservatism. Kirk outlines the intellectual history and principles of conservatism, emphasizing the importance of tradition, order, and moral values as the bedrock of a stable society.\n\n- **_The Conscience of a Conservative_** **by Barry Goldwater** was published in 1960. It provides a political manifesto for American conservatism. Goldwater articulates his beliefs in limited government, individual liberty, and free-market capitalism. This book laid the intellectual groundwork for Goldwater’s presidential campaign in 1964, which then paved the way for Ronald Reagan’s election as president in 1980.\n\n- **_The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945_** **by George H. Nash** was published in 1976. It gives an in-depth analysis of the post-World War II conservative intellectual movement. Nash explores the ideas and individuals who shaped the conservative resurgence, including William F. Buckley Jr., Russell Kirk, and Milton Friedman.\n\n- **_The Closing of the American Mind_** **by Allan Bloom** was published in 1987. It critiques the state of higher education in the United States. Bloom argues that the prevailing moral relativism on college campuses is eroding the foundations of Western civilization. He emphasizes the importance of a classical education as the antidote to decadence.\n\n- **_The Conservative Heart: How to Build a Fairer, Happier, and More Prosperous America_** **by Arthur C. Brooks** was published in 2015. It presents a compassionate conservative vision for addressing societal challenges. Brooks argues that conservative principles, such as free enterprise and limited government, can help alleviate poverty and promote individual opportunity. He emphasizes the importance of human dignity, community, and entrepreneurship.\n\n- **_The Road to Serfdom_** **by Friedrich Hayek** was published in 1944. It has been an influence on both the conservative and libertarian movements. Hayek, a Nobel laureate, argues against the collectivist ideologies of socialism and fascism and predicts that “liberal” planned economies are likely to evolve in a totalitarian direction.\n\n**_Capitalism and Freedom_** **by Milton Friedman** was published in 1962. This is another book that has influenced both the conservative and libertarian movements. Friedman, who was also a Nobel laureate like Hayek, advocates for free-market capitalism, limited government intervention, and individual liberty to solve social problems.\n\n![](https://www.theadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Are-your-beliefs-coercive-1-scaled.jpg)\n\n## Ready to take the latest test for Conservatives?\n\nThe Human Respect Test is

    "text": "\n \n Throughout its history, the central organizing principles of the Republican Party have been support for laissez-faire capitalism, deregulation, and the interests of private enterprise. In the past, the Republican governing philosophy, conservatism, tempered support for free markets with a skepticism about all ideologies, including laissez-faire capitalism, and a realization that government had a responsibility to act to correct intolerable situations and to adjust to changing conditions. \n \n In response to the New Deal, however, a more virulent strain of conservatism was born. This “movement conservatism,” which was funded by wealthy business executives who resented government “interference” in the market and was inspired by the economic theories of Friedrich von Hayek, Ludwig von Misesand later Milton Friedman, rejected skepticism about the dangers of ideology and the need for government action to adapt to new conditions. \n \n Movement conservatism, which has now dominated the Republican Party for nearly fifty years, adopted this free market ideology as its creed and a return to a pre-New Deal ancien regime as its goal. In the words of Hayek, there should be a “sweeping away of the obstacles to free growth” (i.e., government action) and a confidence that “self-regulating forces of the market will somehow bring about the required adjustments to new conditions.” \n \n In adopting this governing philosophy, the modern Republican Party has taken a small number of truths, like the dynamic nature of markets to create wealth and the inalienable right to liberty, and ignored other truths, like pragmatism, equality, fairness, responsibility, community and the interdependence of all society’s citizens. In contrast, Democrats believe in free markets, but also know that reasonable regulation, consumer and workplace protections, and a strong social safety net are essential to making capitalism work. \n \n Not surprisingly, despite more than eighty years of determined effort by conservatives, it turns out that laissez-faire capitalism does not work. Republican laissez-faire policies in the 1920s and early 1930s contributed to –and then exacerbated – the Great Depression. The supply-side economics and deregulation implemented by Republican administrations decades later resulted in continued, record-breaking budget deficits, the financial and savings and loan crises, and, by 2007, the highest share of national income to the top one-tenth of one percent since 1913. \n \n The fact is that the economy has performed significantly better under Democratic administrations than Republican administrations. Between 1960 and 2008, Democratic presidents produced stronger economic growth and larger increases in median family income and lower unemployment, federal spending, federal deficits, and inflation. In the eighty years between the start of the Hoover Administration and the end of the George W. Bush Administration, job growth was higher under all six Democratic Presidents than under any of the seven Republican Presidents. The statistical probability of that happening through random chance is more than \n 1,700 to 1. \n \n In a striking example of “be careful what you wish for,” Wall Street speculators and financiers may be surprised to learn that since 1929 an investment of $10,000 in the S&amp;P stock market index during only Republican administrations would have yielded a return of just $11,733. By contrast, that same $10,000 invested during Democratic administrations would have grown to $300,671. ( New York Times, October 14, 2008) \n \n Based on this record, one would expect 2009 to be a time for soul searching for Republicans –re-thinking their principles and making fundamental changes to their policy agenda. To the contrary, as we have seen over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, Republicans in Congress continue to profess the same faith in unregulated markets and, in some cases, the same dream of turning the clock back to 1932. \n \n If Republicans regain power but fail to learn the lessons of why their governing philosophy has failed in practice, the United States will be doomed to repeat the financial crises, deep economic downturns, and dismal economic results that have resulted from Republican economic policies over the last 80 years. \n \n Growing Insecurity for American Families \n \n The economic policies of the Bush Administration ushered in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2008 contracted at a rate of over six percent. Hundreds of thousands of Americans lost their jobs, with the national unemployment rate hitting a 25-year high of 8.1 percent in February 2009. Median household income, adjusted for inflation declined by $2,197 between 2000 and 2008. Home foreclosures increased by more than 80 percent in 2008. The number of Americans living in poverty reached 39.8 million by 2008, an increase of 8.2 million since 2000. \n \n The Philosophy Behind the Failure \n \n The Bush Administration led the country into the economic crisis with a set of policies that combined a laissez-faire approach to markets with supply-side economics, a largely-discredited theory that asserts economic growth and balanced budgets are best achieved by providing tax breaks to corporations and very wealthy individuals. Supply-side economists believe that reducing tax rates on income and capital gains frees up money for investment, which in turn, will spur economic growth. Many supply-siders argue that this growth is so great that tax cuts for the wealthy inevitably lead to more federal revenue and lower budget deficits. \n \n The problem is that, in practice, supply-side theory has not worked. The real effect of these Republican tax breaks for the wealthy has been record deficits and a declining standard of living for millions of Americans. The tax breaks neither encouraged the capital investments needed to spur long-term economic growth, nor did they provide economic relief to families facing lower wages and increased job insecurity. As a result, over the course of the Bush Administration, poverty rates increased, income inequality worsened, and the budget deficit exploded. \n \n The majority of the tax breaks the Bush Administration pushed through primarily benefited the wealthiest Americans. The average annual size of the 2001-2004 tax cut was $103,086 for millionaires and $684 for households earning less than $100,000. In 2007, the top 20 percent of taxpayers received almost 70 percent of the President’s tax cuts. Ultimately, the Republican tax cuts for the wealthy came at a significant cost to middle-class Americans and the U.S. economy. \n \n President Bush inherited a unified budget surplus of $236 billion from President Clinton, the largest surplus in American history. Surpluses were expected to continue for at least another ten years when President Bush took office in January 2001. However, by 2002 the unified federal budget had returned to a deficit of $160 billion, and by the end of President Bush’s time in office the deficit had reached an historic high of $1.3 trillion. \n \n Republicans also presided over the fastest accumulations of government debt in the history of the United States. During the Bush Administration, federal debt nearly doubled. When President Bush took office in 2001, the debt was $5.7 trillion. When he left office in 2009, President Bush had pushed the debt to $10.6 trillion, approximately $35,000 for every man, woman and child in America. \n \n The costs of these economic policies have been enormous. While supporters of GOP tax breaks claim that their positive economic effects have lowered their cost, the non-partisan Congressional Research Service found in a September 2006 report that “at the current time, as the stimulus effects have faded and the effect of added debt service has grown, the 2001-2004 tax cuts are probably costing more than their estimated revenue cost.” The Republican tax cuts for the wealthiest, and the ideology upon which they are based, ignore the fact that, eventually, someone will have to pay for them. \n \n More of the Same \n \n The Republican solution to the greatest economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression has been a “doubling down” on the same economic policies that helped get us into this recession in the first place: more tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations at the expense of the middle class, and more opposition to badly-needed regulation of markets. \n \n In February of this year, a number of Republican Senators went to the floor to once again tout the conservative fiscal mantra. Senator Kylsummed up their message when he claimed, “The best fiscal policy to stimulate the economy is a deficit-financed tax cut.” \n \n House Republicans promoted a budget alternative this year that would have maintained tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, repealed the investments made through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and rolled back critical domestic programs during a time when hardworking middle-class families are struggling more than they have in generations. Such economic policies would discourage economic growth in the midst of a deep recession and further increase the economic insecurity of American families. \n \n The Financial and Housing Crisis \n \n At a time when American families were already facing financial insecurity, Republican deregulation and lax oversight opened the door to widespread abuses in the housing and financial sectors and culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. \n \n In 2008, more than 2.3 million U.S. properties faced foreclosure, an 81 percent increase from the previous year. This was added to the 1.3 million properties that were foreclosed on in 2007, a 75 percent increase from 2006. And while Democrats believe we can lower this number through aggressive homeowner assistance programs, measures enacted to promote job creation and economic growth, and health care reform, early forecasts project that overall foreclosures could rise by 2.4 million in 2009 and by nine million over the next three years. \n \n The cost to our national economy has been great. The Center for Responsible Lending reports that in 2009 alone, foreclosures could lead to nearly 70 million neighboring homes losing $500 billion in property value. This number does not take into account the cost of an undermined tax base, businesses closings, increased crime and costs associated with widespread home abandonment, nor does it reflect the economic impact on the national and international economy that we have seen since the crash of the housing market. \n \n Part of the collateral damage from this economic crisis has been the retirement security of millions of Americans caused by both the downturn in the housing market and the steep decline of the stock market. The latter sent the values of 401(k) plans into a tailspin. By March 2009, the Dow had fallen over 50 percent, which is worse than any other bear market since the Great Depression of 1929. After the failure of Bear Stearns in March 2008, the Dow dropped from a high of 14,164 points to 11,000. This 20 percent drop was not the end of the crisis. In September 2008, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, triggering an additional 13 percent drop in the stock market in October. By the last full day of President Bush’s term on January 20, 2009, the stock market had fallen to 7,949, a total decline of nearly 44 percent. \n \n The Philosophy Behind the Failure \n \n These crises were driven by Republican opposition to meaningful regulation and oversight, both core principles of their free-market ideology. Conservatives view the market as an efficient allocator of resources and argue that regulation of the market is somehow “unnatural” and leads to inefficiencies and increased costs for business. Republicans believe that the best regulation is no government regulation of the market or at most voluntary, self-regulation by companies. In practice, Republicans combine this philosophical approach with policies that often game markets to benefit the wealthy and business interests. \n \n In the case of the housing and financial market crises, Congressional Republicans and the Bush Administration took advantage of legitimate efforts to expand homeownership and encourage sound economic growth. They pushed an agenda that reversed New Deal-era protections – which eliminated the recurrent financial crises that had regularly struck the United States since the late 18th Century– while willfully failing to develop new financial regulatory measures to keep pace with new and more complex financial products. As noted in the recent GAO report, “Financial Regulation: Recent Crisis Reaffirms the Need to Overhaul the U.S. Regulatory System,” Bush Administration regulators ushered in a new era of non-regulation and failed “to identify the systemic risks posed by large and interconnected financial conglomerates, as well as new and complex products, and to adequately manage these risks.” \n \n The scandals that arose at Enron near the beginning of this decade, including puffed up corporate balance sheets and electricity market manipulation, provided perhaps the first clear example that the Bush Administration would put little energy into preventing abuses at institutions central to the nation’s financial and economic strength. But it was in the ensuing crises in the housing and financial markets that the Administration took this recklessness to an extreme. \n \n The Failures of Deregulation. During the late 1990s and into this decade, subprime mortgages were increasingly used as an alternative to prime mortgages to help Americans with limited or blemished credit achieve the dream of homeownership. These loans also helped millions more homeowners, many of whom were older Americans with good credit, but on fixed incomes, refinance their homes. Unfortunately, while many lenders and brokers offered these mortgages fairly and responsibly, many others took advantage of the Bush Administration’s unwillingness to regulate and supervise markets, and engaged in predatory or irresponsible lending practices and used aggressive and manipulative tactics to steer vulnerable borrowers into “exploding” adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) they could never afford, trapping them in high-interest loans with costly pre-payment penalties, and then immediately selling-off the loans to investors. \n \n Although it was clear by 2003 that these subprime ARMs were defaulting at disproportionate rates, investors, attracted by the potential for higher returns and bolstered by questionably high ratings by credit rating agencies, began purchasing these mortgage-backed securities from lenders and created a perverse incentive structure in which lenders were paid more for selling risky, then even riskier loan products to unsophisticated borrowers. Moreover, where credit agencies did not give triple- and double-A ratings, investors repackaged higher-risk mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) – essentially an insurance policy on the value of the bond, which could then also be sold as AAA or AA securities. \n \n At the height of the housing bubble, this market “worked” because most homeowners were able to prevent defaults by refinancing their home at a lower rate or selling their home for a profit. Unfortunately, when the housing bubble burst, refinancing became more difficult, selling became impossible for some, and defaults increased as the interest rates on ARMs adjusted higher and higher. Combined with an already weakened economy, home foreclosures accelerated, leading to the collapse of the mortgage-backed securities market, and then to the collapse of related markets, which in turn impacted nearly every segment of the economy. According to the “Special Report on Regulatory Reform,” released by the Congressional Oversight Panel (COP) in January 2009: “Only when the housing market turned down and delinquencies and foreclosures started to rise, beginning in 2006–07, did the issuers, investors, and rating agencies finally recognize how severely they had underestimated the key risks involved.” \n \n As all of this was happening, the Bush Administration’s laissez-faire regulatory approach to markets contributed to regulators turning a blind eye to abuses in the housing market. The Bush Administration ignored warning signs about risky mortgages, failed to regulate credit default swaps, mortgage-backed securities and other new financial products, and encouraged practices that were major contributors to the subprime mortgage and financial crises. Moreover, leaning again on their erroneous belief that the market would self-correct, even once it was clear that the housing market had crashed and was threatening the entire U.S. economy, Republican leaders refused to take immediate and aggressive action to prevent a total collapse. \n \n Take for example former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, who ignored warnings about the instability of the subprime mortgage market and the potential for predatory lending until it was too late. Despite his regulatory and supervisory responsibilities, Mr. Greenspan’s policies and priorities reflected only his enthusiasm for free markets and less regulation. Thus, it is unsurprising that he declined to heed the warnings of fellow Federal Reserve Board member Edward Gramlich, who informed Greenspan of the evident risks associated with subprime mortgages and predatory lending, and their implications for the broader economy. \n \n Mr. Gramlich, who chaired the Fed’s Committee on Consumer and Community Affairs, had been watching the growth of the subprime mortgage market with concern. According to the Wall Street Journal, Gramlich advised Mr. Greenspan “in or around 2000, when predatory lending was a growing concern, that the Fed use its discretionary authority to send examiners to the offices of consumer-finance lenders that were units of Fed-regulated bank holding companies.” Gramlich said that he “would have liked the Fed to be a leader in cracking down on predatory lending… Knowing it would be controversial with Mr. Greenspan, whose deregulatory philosophy is well known…[Gramlich] broached it to him personally rather than take it to the full board.” But Greenspan “was opposed to it, so [Gramlich] didn’t really pursue it.” According to the Washington Post, in 2003, Gramlich was briefed by Bruce Gottschall, a respected Chicago housing expert, who “pull[ed] out a map of Chicago, showing the Fed governor which communities had been exposed to large numbers of subprime loans. Homes were going into foreclosure. Gottschall said [Gramlich] already ‘seemed to know some of the underlying problems.’” \n \n Asked in 2007 why he did not follow Mr. Gramlich’s advice, Mr. Greenspan justified his failure to investigate predatory lending in the mortgage market with the explanation that it would not have been worth the effort and represented the part of his job that was anathema to him. He noted that, while he does not recall the specific conversation, “[f]or us to go in and audit how they act on their mortgage applications would have been a huge effort, and it’s not clear to me we would have found anything that would have been worthwhile without undermining the desired availability of subprime credits.” Further, according to the Washington Post, “Mr. Greenspan said he didn’t get heavily involved in regulatory matters in part because his laissez-faire philosophy was often at odds with the goals of the laws Congress had tasked the Fed with enforcing.” \n \n Instead, he encouraged the use of subprime mortgages. In 2004 – well after early reports of high foreclosures in the subprime market – Mr. Greenspan declared: “American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed rate mortgage…the traditional fixed-rate mortgage may be an expensive method of financing a home.” In 2005 speech, he congratulated the financial services industry for creating them: “A brief look back at the evolution of the consumer finance market reveals that the financial services industry has long been competitive, innovative, and resilient…Innovation has brought about a multitude of new products, such as subprime loans and niche credit programs for immigrants…[I]ndeed, today subprime mortgages account for roughly 10 percent of the number of all mortgages outstanding, up from just 1 or 2 percent in the early 1990s.” \n \n It was not until 2006 that Mr. Greenspan began showing some reservations. According to the Washington Post, “Greenspan puzzled over one piece of data a Fed employee showed him in his final weeks. A trade publication reported that subprime mortgages had ballooned to 20 percent of all loans, triple the level of a few years earlier. ‘I looked at the numbers…and said, “Where did they get these numbers from?”’…He was skeptical that such loans had grown in a short period ‘to such gargantuan proportions.’” Even then though, “Greenspan said he did not recall whether he mentioned the dramatic growth in subprime loans to his successor, Ben S. Bernanke.” \n \n Later, in the wake of the subprime and financial sector market crisis, Mr. Greenspan admitted that “while I was aware a lot of these practices were going on, I had no notion of how significant they had become until very late…I really didn’t get it until very late in 2005 and 2006.” Moreover, he admits the flaws in free-market ideology. In his exchange with Representative Waxman at Congressional hearings on the matter, Greenspan noted that, “he had been ‘partially’ wrong in not having tried to regulate the market for credit default swaps.” As reported by the New York Times: \n \n Pressed by Waxman, Greenspan conceded a more serious flaw in his own philosophy that unfettered free markets sit at the root of a superior economy. “I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of organizations, specifically banks and others, were such as that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms,” Greenspan said. Waxman pushed the former Fed chief, who left office in 2006, to clarify his explanation. “In other words, you found that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working,” Waxman said. “Absolutely, precisely,” Greenspan replied. \n \n Like Mr. Greenspan, the former Republican Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Congressman Mike Oxley, has acknowledged the role that free-market ideology played in causing the housing and financial crises. Commenting on the failure to enact a 2005 bill to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Mr. Oxley stated last year, “We missed a golden opportunity that would have avoided a lot of the problems we’re facing now if we hadn’t had such a firm ideological position at the White House and the Treasury and the Fed.” \n \n The Failures of Non-Regulation and Non-Enforcement. The anti-regulatory attitude at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during the Bush Administration also created a tilted playing field in favor of businesses at the expense of the consumer and stability of the economy. This was more than simply a laissez-faire approach to enforcement. The SEC put their thumb on the scale to actively benefit business interests, in violation of its tripartite mandate to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. \n \n After his appointment as Chairman of the SEC in 2005, former Republican Congressman Christopher Cox instituted new policies that subjected SEC investigators who wanted to subpoena documents or compel interviews to an increasingly cumbersome process to win the Commission’s approval to pursue each case. Two years into his term, Chairman Cox began requiring enforcement attorneys to seek approval from commissioners before negotiating corporate penalties. Commissioners increasingly barred enforcement-unit personnel from meetings during which legal action and financial sanctions were considered. SEC staff was also cut, with the number of investigative attorneys falling 11.5 percent between 2004 and 2008. \n \n These new policies incentivized corporations not to cooperate with SEC investigations, generated a backlog of cases, and led to fewer and smaller corporate fines. Between 2005 and 2008, penalties imposed on companies fell 84 percent. An attorney speaking on condition of anonymity said it was “widely felt” that commissioners prevented the division from “doing its job.” But Chairman Cox received accolades from Congressional Republicans for his work. Congressman David Dreier commented, “It is fitting that [Cox] is now the country’s top cop for the securities markets because he has long been committed to improving and supporting the free market.” \n \n One of the most egregious cases of SEC enforcement negligence was its failure to uncover the $50 billion financial fraud of Bernard Madoff, a prominent Wall Street money manager and former NASDAQ chairman. An investigation by the SEC’s Inspector General recently concluded that “the SEC never conducted a competent and thorough examination or investigation of Madoff for operating a Ponzischeme and that, had such a proper examination or investigation been conducted, the SEC would have been able to uncover the fraud.” Madoffhimself expressed astonishment that the SEC did not verify the trades he claimed to be making. It took just a single phone call to Depository Trust Company, an important financial intermediary, after the Ponzi scheme was exposed in December 2008, to find out thatMadoff in fact had not placed any of these trades. \n \n The SEC also failed to follow up on credible tips. Money manager Harry Markopolos sought several times to persuade the SEC to investigate Bernard Madoff. “I gift-wrapped and delivered the largest Ponzi scheme in history to them and somehow they couldn’t be bothered to conduct a thorough and proper investigation because they were too busy on matters of higher priority,” Markopolos said. “If a $50 billion Ponzi scheme doesn’t make the SEC’s priority list, then I want to know who sets their priorities.” In the end, it wasn’t until federal authorities were tipped off by Madoff’s own sons, to whom Madoff had confessed the true nature of his investment scheme, that federal charges were finally brought against Madoff. \n \n The Bush SEC’s record was equally dismal with respect to Bear Stearns. Three days before the 85-year old investment bank collapsed in March 2008, Chairman Cox reassured investors on the health of Bear Stearns. Yet reports by the SEC’s Inspector General following the bank’s collapse documented a series of missteps by the SEC, including a decision by the Commission’s Miami office to drop an inquiry into securities sold by Bear Stearns. The IG also concluded that the SEC had failed to maintain adequate oversight of the firm in the months leading up to its collapse. \n \n Private firms that should have, in the view of Republican policy-makers, played a role in safeguarding markets also failed. Investors depend on credit-rating agencies, such as Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s, for independent, objective analysis. Yet these agencies continually underestimated risks and assigned high ratings on security issues. One of the problems was that credit agencies were being paid for their work by the bankers issuing the securities that were being rated. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, for instance, uncovered a presentation for Moody’s directors in October 2007 that acknowledged that credit agencies were “continually ‘pitched’by bankers, issuers, investors,” and admitted that, at times, “we drink the Kool-Aid.” \n \n More of the Same \n \n The massive numbers of home foreclosures, the sharp decline in home values, and the retirement insecurity of millions are due largely to the regulatory and enforcement failures of the Bush Administration. Yet Republicans continue to cling to the same laissez-faire approach that led to the current crisis. They claim that government interference is costly for businesses, taxpayers and consumers. And despite their willingness to agree to individual pieces of legislation to deal with aspects of the housing and financial crisis, there appears to be no taste among Republicans in Congress for the sort of systemic restructuring of the financial regulatory system that is needed to prevent a return to the pre-New Deal era of recurrent financial crises. \n \n As the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression emerged over the past 18 months, and as studies from a variety of sources spelled out the role that lax oversight played in creating the conditions for and deepening the crisis, conservative think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) issued report after report questioning the value of financial regulatory measures. A report issued by AEI in October 2008 argued that “the financial crisis provides no warrant either for a systemic risk regulator or for the supervision of other participants in the financial markets that have not previously been regulated.” The following month, the organization issued a report that blamed the housing crisis solely on the “ill-considered government intervention in the private economy.” \n \n A report released in January of this year by AEI fellow Peter Wallisonasks: “Why should regulation be extended to most of the major players in the financial system when it has been a consistent failure for banks?” The premise of the analysis is, of course, inaccurate and betrays a continuing conservative bias against regulation. In a July 2009 report, “Unfree to Choose” – a twist on Milton Friedman’s classic text of market fundamentalism – Mr. Wallison called the Consumer Financial Protection Agency Act of 2009 “one of the most far-reaching and intrusive federal laws ever proposed by an administration.” \n \n In an April 2009 Heritage Foundation report on credit derivatives, David Mason argues that policymakers should encourage “market reforms” for market problems. He writes that “markets themselves will often correct deficiencies far more rapidly than regulators…regulators can often act more effectively by encouraging private parties to devise market solutions to market problems whenever possible…” \n \n Republicans continue to pursue policies that minimize the need for government regulation because of their belief that markets are self-adjusting. In January of this year, Senator Kyl stated on the floor of the Senate that“The government cannot create economic growth. In fact, when the government gets involved, there is more potential to do harm than good. We can tax them, we can regulate them. Usually, it does not do them any good.” Senator DeMint followed up a week later lamenting “[f]rankly, it doesn’t make me feel any better to know that this government is intervening in the private sector and every place it touches, it is going to bring new rules and regulations and make our economy less likely to operate as it should.” Senator Kyl returned to the floor in August, arguing that “The private market has an adequate way to deal with this; it is called the private sector, private companies. They are highly regulated. The proposal from the administration is to impose additional regulations, but why do we need a new government company?” \n \n As the House Financial Services Committee began marking up a bill last July to overhaul the rules governing the financial sector and to create the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, Republican Representatives Royce andHensarling announced their intentions to oppose the bill – based on what Roll Call called their “common philosophy on limiting the role of government.” Representative Hensarling, the former Chairman of the House Republican Study Committee, called the proposed consumer protection agency in the bill “one of the greatest assaults on economic liberty in my lifetime…It says to the American people, ‘You are simply too ignorant or too dumb to be trusted with economic freedom.’” \n \n Moreover, the two Republican Commissioners on the Securities and Exchange Commission continue to support the same corporate-friendly policies that were the hallmark of Chairman Cox’s tenure. In May 2009, the SEC proposed giving shareholders greater power to nominate corporate directors, which had been tightly controlled by company management. This would effectively overturn a 2007 SEC decision that allows companies to exclude shareholder proposals for director nominations from corporate ballots. The new SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro and two Democratic Commissioners supported the proposal to overturn Mr. Cox’s policy saying the time had come to give shareholders a real say in determining who will oversee their company. The two Republican SEC Commissioners, on the other hand, objected. \n \n Health Care \n \n President Bush had eight years to improve our nation’s health care system. But the President and his Republican allies in Congress – who valued tax cuts for the wealthy, pursued ideological policies, and rewarded special interests –produced dismal results. Skyrocketing health care costs are straining family budgets as well as state budgets, forcing employers to drop or scale back health insurance coverage for their workers, increasing the number of uninsured Americans, and impeding access to needed health care services. \n \n By the final year of the Bush Administration, the average annual premium cost for family health coverage had reached $12,608, compared with $6,438 in 2000. Over the course of the Administration, an additional 6.9 million Americans lost their health insurance coverage, leaving 45.7 million Americans currently uninsured. During just the past two years, approximately 87 million people were uninsured at some point. And having a job does not guarantee access to health insurance, as more than 80 percent of the uninsured are in working families. \n \n Even for those Americans fortunate to have health insurance, our health care system does not provide the consistent, quality care they need and deserve, nor does it accurately reflect the $2.2 trillion annual investment we make. A 2003 RAND Corporation study concluded that adults receive just 55 percent of recommended care, and adults with diabetes received just 45 percent of the care they require. \n \n The Philosophy Behind the Failure \n \n While insurance premiums were doubling for the typical American family, Republicans continued to advocate a transformation of our health care system with the expansion of High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) and the creation of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), where most Americans would shop for health insurance on their own in a highly deregulated market, and consumers would be charged greater deductibles and co-payments to encourage them to use less care. While that might be fine for the healthy and wealthy, HDHPs and HSAs are not a reasonable solution for the health care needs of all Americans. \n \n The theory is that the marketplace is all that is needed to keep health insurers in check, even though the reality is that this approach would reduce costs for insurers at the expense of people, shifting more costs to older and sicker patients –the very people who are struggling the most to afford health care. Even in the current market, insurance companies deny or price-out of coverage nearly nine out of every ten Americans who apply for insurance in the individual market. Despite this evidence, Republicans still maintain that the government has no role in limiting health insurers’ ability to deny coverage to sick people, drastically increase premiums at renewal, or rescind coverage after a policyholder generates substantial medical costs. \n \n The Bush Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress also pushed a series of changes to Medicare that benefited the special interests. While seeking drastic cuts in reimbursement for traditional Medicare, Republicans fought to protect Medicare’s current practice of paying private insurance companies 14 percent more, on average, than it costs to treat the same beneficiaries under traditional Medicare – overpayments that will cost taxpayers more than $150 billion over ten years according to the Congressional Budget Office. \n \n President Bush vetoed legislation that would have reversed the scheduled 10.6 percent cut in payments to physicians who care for the 44 million American seniors in the Medicare program, and saved billions of taxpayer dollars by reducing overpayments to some private Medicare plans. And the Republican Medicare prescription drug benefit plan, with the support of the drug companies, prohibited using Medicare’s purchasing power to allow the Health and Human Services Secretary to negotiate lower-priced drugs with pharmaceutical companies. \n \n President Bush’s health care agenda also had devastating results for America’s children. He twice vetoed bills to renew and improve the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and he directed state health officials to severely limit states’ ability to cover uninsured children though CHIP. \n \n More of the Same \n \n Despite overwhelming evidence that the U.S. health care system is broken and in desperate need of a bold, new approach, conservatives in Congress continue to push the same “market-based” ideas that ignore millions of uninsured working people, leaving them unprotected in an unregulated market in which insurance companies write the rules and health care costs skyrocket. Republicans in Congress have yet to come up with any comprehensive health care plan in 2009, but the GOP party platform adopted last year continues to support the same free-market approach that does little to reduce health care costs for American families or to help them get coverage when the insurance industry deems them‘uninsurable.’ \n \n Republicans continue to draw inspiration for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) from conservative think tanks. A 2009 Cato Institute Handbook for Policymakers argues that “Consumers should make choices about whether, where, and how much health insurance and medical care to purchase based on their values.” The Heritage Foundation also pushes this policy as a way to “level the playing field for robust competition among insurers and create a level of consumer choice that is routine in every other sector of the American economy.” \n \n Under this“free market” health care system, citizens, including seniors, would have to“shop around” for insurance, pushing families Americans to make health choices based solely on cost, without consideration for coverage or care quality. Republicans say the policy would encourage working people to stop “overusing”their doctors, but the policy, in fact, hinges on the notion that most people can afford to pay more for health care. A 2006 policy paper by the Cato Institute even goes as far as saying Health Savings Accounts will work because “many older people use very little medical care.” \n \n But these private insurance plans by definition would carry high deductibles, so families would have to shell out thousands of dollars before insurance payments would kick in. Only the wealthy and the healthy could afford the care they need. For working people – especially sick people who have to visit the doctor often – it would be nearly impossible to set aside enough money for to cover those deductibles. The plan essentially discourages struggling families from going to the doctor at all. \n \n The 2008 Republican platform also does little to address the underlying problems in the health system: insurance companies could still deny care at will, even after individuals are forced to pay thousands out of pocket. And HDHPs/HSAs would do nothing to lower the cost of health care or provide care to the uninsured. \n \n One new health care idea has emerged, however, from conservative Republicans in Congress this year. They now say they want to phase out Medicare by 2021 in favor of privatizing health care for the nation’s seniors. ( Wall Street Journal, April 1, 2009) This effort echoes the failed policy Republicans followed in 2005, when they proposed privatizing Social Security by allowing people to invest their social safety net funds in the stock market. Democrats – then in the minority – fought this plan tooth and nail. The stock market fell sharply a few years later – and our Social Security system averted disaster. \n \n The GOP Medicare reform plan, released in April 2009 as part of their alternative budget, would make Americans under 54 ineligible for Medicare once they turn 65 and leave them in the hands of private insurers. These Americans would have to choose a new private insurance plan that provides a standard Medicare benefits package or some other managed care option while freeing insurance companies from current Medicare rules designed to contain health care costs for seniors. \n \n While Republican Congressional leaders claim they would subsidize the costs of the new private senior health system based on family income – so those earning less would receive more government help – the Congressional Budget Office analysis of a similar plan from the 1990s estimated that turning Medicare over to the private sector would increase out-of-pocket costs for all seniors currently on Medicare. Subsidies would never be enough to cover the true costs of health care for seniors. Also, members of the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare who examined similar proposals “expressed concerns that this approach would undermine the basic protections offered by Medicare as a social insurance program, by relegating lower-income beneficiaries to lower-cost, and possibly lower-quality, plans.” \n \n It is also unlikely these subsidies would be able to keep up with skyrocketing health care costs. FamiliesUSA estimates that between 2000 and 2007, health care premiums increased 78.3 percent while median worker earnings went up only 14.5 percent. The Republican plan just doesn’t add up. \n \n Energy and the Environment \n \n The Republican record on energy and the environment is the story of one Party’s crusade to maintain the status quo. Toward this end, Republicans have stood against innovation by opposing renewable energy sources and any significant efforts to improve energy efficiency, done little to curtail our dependence on foreign oil, and have been largely silent on how to address global warming pollution. The impact of this record is one that threatens our national security, the public’s health, and the nation’s ability to compete in the 21 st century global economy. \n \n The Philosophy Behind the Failure \n \n In their drive to protect entrenched interests, Republicans have resisted innovation and disregarded the need to address climate change. They have relied on laissez-faire principles to argue that incentivizing innovative technologies would – regardless of the seriousness of global warming – distort markets and impose unnecessary costs on the economy and consumers. The evidence they marshal to support their hands-off approach typically includes a set of hypothetical economic arguments about cause and effect that in fact rarely bear any relation to empirical reality. \n \n The Republican Party’s long history of protecting the petroleum industry culminated in the release of the Bush Administration’s National Energy Policy in May 2001. Developed with the extensive involvement of the oil and gas industry in a series of secret energy task force meetings convened by Vice President Cheney, the policy focused on increasing energy supplies, but included next to nothing on efficiency and renewable energy and rejected measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. True to form, the Bush Administration asked corporate polluters to voluntarily cut emissions and suggested“market-based” alternatives to environmental protections. \n \n So it should not be surprising that in 2008 the United States imported more than two billion barrels of oil from OPEC. Between 2001 and 2008, the amount that the United States sent to foreign countries to pay for its addiction to oil increased more than four times, from approximately $101 billion to $439 billion. Meanwhile, since 2001, the profits of the major oil companies skyrocketed to record levels while crude oil prices were similarly increasing. The cumulative profits of the major oil companies from 2001 to 2008 totaled $666 billion. \n \n More of the Same \n \n As the oil industry rung up record profits, Congress debated the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. In yet another bid to protect the industry interests, Republicans stripped language from the bill to set a renewable electricity standard and enact renewable energy tax credits, which would have been paid for by eliminating tax breaks for major oil companies, after President Bush threatened to veto the legislation. The Administration also passed up opportunities to promote economic growth through investments in green jobs and renewable energy – inaction which, together with other failed Bush Republican economic policies, contributed to the loss of hundreds of thousands of construction and manufacturing jobs over the course of the Bush Administration. \n \n One constant in Republican energy policy has been a willingness to ignore the scientific consensus on both climate change and the role that humans have played in that change. In this, Republicans continue to draw support from an army of pundits and conservative think tank analysts who pedal the same principles that prevented significant action to address climate change throughout the Bush Administration. \n \n Frank Luntz, the Republican message guru, urged congressional Republicans in 2004 to argue that “global warming is not a fact.” In 2005, Philip Cooney, a Bush Administration official, former lobbyist, and“climate team leader” at the American Petroleum Institute, “repeatedly edited government climate reports in ways that play down links between such emissions and global warming.” And in 2006, a 24-year old NASA government affairs official attempted to censor remarks on climate change by senior NASA official James Hansen. \n \n Earlier this year, House Republican Minority Leader Boehner mocked concerns over global warming and conservative pundit George Will called global warming a“hypothetical calamity.” Energy analysts at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Heritage Foundation continue to reject the human role in climate change or dramatically downplay its significance. One analyst at the Heritage Foundation continued the strategy of sowing doubt by claiming falsely that “more and more people are questioning the so-called hype on global warming.” \n \n The most recent organized effort to question the science of climate change is CO2 is Green, an advocacy group spearheaded by two veteran oil industry executives. Pushing the rhetoric one step further, the group not only denies the scientific evidence for climate change, it argues that “higher CO2 levels than we have today would help the Earth’s ecosystems” and that efforts to address climate change would be harmful to humans and the environment. The group also joins other industry associations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in decrying what they erroneously claim are the economic costs of addressing climate change. \n \n Education \n \n Republicans have repeatedly put special interests ahead of the needs of middle-class college students struggling to pay for a four-year degree. As the costs of higher education skyrocketed over the past eight years, conservatives fought increases for Pell Grants – a program that has proven to be indispensable for millions of students who might not otherwise have had the financial resources to pursue a college degree. This left students increasingly dependent on student loans, the majority of which were controlled by a private student lending market that presided over ever-rising interest rates. The combination of fewer grants and higher loan balances at higher interest rates has prevented qualified students from obtaining college degrees and left many graduates burdened with large student debt. \n \n Since the 2001-2002 academic year, college costs have risen dramatically. Average tuition, fees, room and board costs at four-year private universities have increased by $10,276, or 43 percent, from $23,856 to $34,132 in the 2008-2009 academic year. Tuition, fees, room and board charges at four-year public colleges jumped from $9,032 to $14,333 for the 2008-2009 academic year – an increase of $5,301, or 58 percent. \n \n The rising cost of a college education means that average student loan debt has soared, to more than $19,000. Without adequate federal grants funding, students and their parents must rely more on student loans to finance their college educations. According to the Institute for College Access and Success, more than 60 percent of college seniors graduate with debt, with an average debt of $19,200 per graduate. Yet at a time when more students and families rely on student loans, the nation’s credit crunch has caused banks to tighten their lending standards, making it more and more difficult for students to take out student loans. Students and their families understandably remain concerned about continued access to student loans. \n \n While students struggle to pay off their loans, the lenders that offer loans to students have been making record profits. The federal government has paid large subsidies to lenders that participate in the federal student loan program– a relic from the program’s inception more than forty years ago when it was believed that incentives were needed to encourage lenders to take part in the program. Recent investigations have shown that lenders have been exploiting the student loan system for profits, to the detriment of the very students they are supposed to be helping. \n \n The Philosophy Behind the Failure \n \n The current student loan system is a perfect illustration of the Republican love of the free market combined with an almost equally ardent love of government subsidies for corporations. Under the current system, the most popular way for a student to get a loan to pay for college is to apply for money from a private lender that is subsidized by the government. Banks and other private companies lend money to students, and the federal government pays part or all of the interest. The government also guarantees the loans. In this system, all of the risk is borne by the government in case of default while the lenders also receive federal subsidies to originate these loans. \n \n This “free market” solution to the problem of rising college costs leaves students who have little or no credit with less access to student loans and makes it more difficult for low-income students to pay for college. It also leaves students vulnerable during a crisis in the financial markets when credit seizes up, as happened in late 2008. The continuing credit crisis is affecting the ability of students and families to afford rising tuition costs. Lenders are increasing their lending standards and not serving certain colleges or populations considered too risky. \n \n This free-market approach to funding higher education no doubt inspired President Bush to ignore his 2000 campaign promise to increase the maximum Pell Grant to $5,100. In 2005, Congress had an opportunity to address the rising cost of attending college by reducing excessive subsidies for student loan lenders and using those savings to substantially increase need-based aid to all students eligible for Pell Grants. But Republicans had other priorities: cutting $12 billion from the student loan program and using it to pay for tax breaks that primarily benefited the wealthy. \n \n As if it was not enough that students were increasingly forced to rely on loans to finance their education, Republicans made a tough situation worse by failing to address rising student loan interest rates. According to the Congressional Research Service, Stafford loan interest rates increased from 3.4 percent to 5.3 percent in 2005, and as of July of 2006, they were up to 6.8 percent on new loans and 7.1 percent for outstanding loans. Again, during the first six years of the Bush Administration, while Democrats supported efforts to make student loans affordable, including lowering interest rates and expanding options to payments to a specified percentage of a borrower’s income, the Republican-controlled Congress did not support efforts to reduce student loan interest rates. In fact, the Republicans’ budget 2006 reconciliation bill actually increased interest rates for PLUS loans to parents, from the previously scheduled fixed rate of 7.9 percent to 8.5 percent. \n \n More of the Same \n \n Despite the obvious flaws in the current student loan system, Congressional Republicans have continued to stand in the way of Democratic policies that would boost student access to college. Republicans opposed President Obama’s budget, which would boost Pell Grants to a maximum of $5,550 in the 2010-2011 school year. They nearly unanimously opposed and attempted to obstruct the Recovery Act and Omnibus bills, which direct more than $36 billion to Pell Grants and other federal student aid programs that help millions of families pay for college. Providing grist for this opposition, the 2009 Cato Institute Handbook for Policymakers argues Congress should phase out all federal student aid and leave loans to the private market. Cato would also phase out federal aid to all higher education institutions and eliminate all grant programs and research unrelated to national security. \n \n Congressional Republicans also oppose President Obama’s plan to end government subsidies for new loans made through the private lender market and redirect the $1 billion in saved subsidies to students in the form of more Pell Grants. Senator Enzi, the ranking Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, reiterated the free market “contempt for government” mantra in deriding Obama’s proposal, arguing that government doesn’t have enough workers with the right skills or the right attitude for meeting the needs of customers. \n \n The Workplace \n \n Each year, nearly 6,000 American workers are killed on the job and another 13 million, or nearly one-tenth of the American workforce, are injured. Under these circumstances, one would expect that the primary federal agency responsible for workplace safety would be given the highest priority. Perhaps not surprisingly, however, the Bush Administration treated the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a haven for former officials of the industries they were charged with overseeing. Bush appointees ordered the withdrawal of dozens of workplace health regulations designed to protect workers from hazardous conditions. They delayed proposed new regulations and bent rules when industry representatives complained safety standards were too strict and too expensive. As David Michaels, an occupational health expert at George Washington University and former Energy Department official noted in 2007, “The people at OSHA have no interest in running a regulatory agency. If they ever knew how to issue regulations, they’ve forgotten. The concern about protecting workers has gone out the window.” \n \n The Philosophy Behind the Failure \n \n The Bush Administration’s record at OSHA represented more of the same ideological commitment to deregulation and non-enforcement – and more of the same inclination to favor the business interests that brought us the financial and housing crises. Driven by this commitment, OSHA pulled 22 items off the agency’s regulatory agenda in the first two years of the Bush Administration alone. The result is what the Washington Post called “a legacy of un-regulation.” From 2001 to the end of 2007, the Post reports that OSHA officials issued 86 percent fewer significant rules or regulations than their counterparts did during a similar period in President Clinton’s tenure. \n \n The Bush Administration began to weaken OSHA right out of the gate. In one of his first acts in office, President Bush signed legislation repealing a key Clinton regulation meant to improve ergonomic standards and reduce worker injuries in factories, construction sites and offices. The reason? The new regulations would be costly to business. The Center for Public Integrity’s 2008 “Broken Government” report lists the Bush OSHA record among the “worst systematic failures” and states the Bush Administration’s decision to overturn the ergonomics standard was indicative of the Administration’s“movement away from enforcement.” \n \n Even a highly-touted Bush Administration initiative that called for OSHA to devote special attention to companies with a troubled history of job-related fatalities was a failure. An April 2009 Labor Department audit that looked at the program’s effectiveness during the Bush Administration found that OSHA officials failed to gather needed data and conducted uneven inspections and enforcement. Officials also failed to identify companies with repeat worker fatalities because OSHA’s own records misspelled the companies’ names or did not indicate when two subsidiaries with the same owner company were involved in worker deaths. \n \n The agency even refused to adopt new standards on hazards that OSHA itself acknowledged were dangerous. Among the regulations proposed by OSHA’s staff but scuttled by Bush appointees was one meant to protect health workers from tuberculosis. Although OSHA concluded in 1997 that the regulation could avert as many as 32,700 infections and 190 deaths annually and save $115 million, it was blocked by opposition from large hospitals. \n \n And, instead of enforcing the regulations that they had not already overturned, the Bush Administration and Republicans in Congress pursued the favored strategy of business interests, namely, a “voluntary compliance strategy,” which required the industry to police itself. Peg Seminario, director of occupational safety and health at the AFL-CIO noted in 2007, “OSHA has been focusing on the best companies in their voluntary protection program while doing nothing in the area of standard setting. They’ve simply gotten out of the standard-setting business in favor of industry partnerships that have no teeth.'” \n \n Bush Administration officials claimed that their regulatory philosophy at OSHA reduced the number of worker fatalities, but public health groups and unions have challenged those claims, concluding that companies underreported injuries on the job and that OSHA simply re-categorized reports of accidents to make it appear the agency had a solid record of protecting workers. Meanwhile, the Center for American Progress reported that in 2007, the median OSHA final penalty for violations that caused a fatality was a mere $3,675. \n \n In March 2009, the GAO released a report on a Bush-era investigation into Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division, the federal agency charged with enforcing minimum wage, overtime and other laws designed to prevent worker abuse. The GAO created 10 fictitious workers with complaints and recorded how the Labor Department handled those complaints, which ranged from workers angry that they had not been paid to reports of underage children working during school hours. The GAO found that the Bush Labor Department mishandled nine of the 10 complaints. Five out of the 10 complaints were not even recorded in the Department’s database. \n \n In one case, a GAO investigator posing as a dishwasher called four times to complain about not being paid overtime. The Labor Department did not return his calls for four months and when it did, the worker was told an investigation would not be started for eight to 10 months. In another particularly shocking example, a GAO investigator posed as a janitor who had a hot-tempered boss who refused to pay him minimum wage. The Labor Department official answering the call suggested the worker should either confront the boss himself about the problem or “have another job lined up” before filing an official complaint“because I can’t guarantee that he’s not going to fire you.” \n \n More of the Same \n \n The Republican fight against regulation continued during a 2008 debate over The Protect America’s Workers Act, legislation that would have boosted OSHA’s overall regulatory role. The bill, backed by Senate Democrats, was designed to expand the coverage of safety laws to 8.6 million more workers and require OSHA to investigate every case where a worker was killed or seriously injured. Democrats said the measure would help shine a light on problems at OSHA, but Republicans defended OSHA’s record under President Bush. \n \n Senator Isakson, the ranking member of the HELP Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee, said the proposed bill went too far to set new safety standards for companies. He tried to protect the prerogatives of Bush-appointed OSHA officials to adopt weaker standards. “You have to be careful when you adopt standards,” he told Congressional Quarterly at the time. “That’s why we have these agencies.” With no sense of irony, Senator Isakson, along with Republican Senators Enzi and Hatch, issued a statement calling these deregulatory OSHA officials “experts” in safety. \n \n In its new 2009 Handbook for Policymakers, the conservative Cato Institute continues to push for the dismantling of worker safety standards. It argues that “the existence of a health risk (in the workplace) does not necessarily imply the need for regulatory action,” as long as workers are paid enough to compensate for the risks they are taking on in accepting the job. \n DPC \n"

Before President George W. Bush left a deep financial crisis and economic collapse on President Barack Obama’s doorstep, he presided over two terms of laissez-faire supply-side policies that yielded the weakest expansion in recent U.S. economic history, marked by tepid job growth, weak private investment, stagnant family incomes, and a host of other ills that mounting housing and financial bubbles helped partially obscure. That President Bush took no action to address the fundamental weakness of the American economy and protect it from financial collapse was a tragic failure—but it was a tragic failure to be expected by a conservative president practicing conservative economics.\n\n#### Conservative economics in the 21st century\n\n- The one-note economic strategy of President George W. Bush, of tax cuts focused on the wealthy, was an abysmal failure yielding the worst investment growth, employment growth and income growth in post-World War II U.S. history—and left the country economically and fiscally exceptionally weak going into the Great Recession.\n- Bush’s failure to address fundamental economic problems was terrible for the country, and the devotion to markets-take-care-ofthemselves ideology in the face of some of the most irresponsible financial market practices in history allowed the financial collapse and its myriad consequences. These policies and their failure were not surprising from a president devoted to a conservative, supplyside, economic philosophy.\n- Conservative members of Congress have stuck to this tried-and failed economic approach. Although the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has created and saved millions of jobs, and warded off a second Great Depression, it would have been more effective but for changes that were made in the Senate to garner conservative votes.\n- Time after time since the beginning of 2009, conservatives have delayed or stopped additional measures to improve the weak economy. Assistance for small business, employment training, support for private sector job creation, infrastructure investment and many other proposals to move the economy from weak recovery to strong growth have been blocked or delayed by conservatives in Congress.\n- The “Pledge to America” offers more of the same.\n\nThis approach sowed the seeds for today’s federal budget deficit, financial crisis, and the Great Recession. And it is no less tragic that those who share that president’s philosophy—and who still retain power through their positions in Congress—are compounding their ideological brother’s mistakes by standing in the way of economic progress and growth.\n\nAfter the Obama administration took office in January 2009, conservatives in Congress worked hard to weaken the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, fought efforts to reform our financial system, and demanded tax breaks for the richest of the rich in exchange for extending unemployment benefits for those who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Now, “Pledge to America” promises more of the same for the American people in the second decade of the 21st century. Theirs is a tried-and-failed economic strategy that continues to hold the nation back from growing prosperity. In this memo we will lay out the crippling consequences of conservative economic ideology over the past decade, today, and into the future.\n\nListening to conservatives, it would be easy to think that America’s economic woes began with the inauguration of President Barack Obama on January 20, 2009. In fact, upon taking office the Obama administration and a new Congress inherited from the previous administration an economy plunging into what threatened to be a second Great Depression. For the prior eight years, President George W. Bush and his administration pursued a one-trick economic policy of supply-side tax cutting that did nothing to address deep-seated structural problems but successfully produced federal budget deficits that left the country fiscally weak going into the Great Recession. At the same time, the Bush administration’s regulators stood by as the financial industry engaged in some of the most catastrophic and irresponsible practices seen in the history of financial markets.\n\nIn retrospect, some leading conservative economists admitted to these failings, but conservatives in Congress did not change their tune. The passage of the Temporary Asset Relief Program, or TARP, late in Bush’s presidency to bring stability to global financial markets on the edge of meltdown was necessary, but its design was hardly reflective of a new way of doing business. And since the changing of the guard in Washington in January 2009, conservatives in Congress have done every thing they can to obstruct efforts to fix the economic mess left at the end of the Bush era. With foot-dragging in committees, threats of filibuster, and other parliamentary tricks in the Senate—where governance rules allow even one lone senator to derail the entire legislative process—they have seriously weakened the national response to our nation’s economic woes.\n\nIt started with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which conservative senators fought in general and then worked to weaken by stripping out more effective job-creating provisions in favor of less effective conservative priorities. These changes, some of which were disdained by even conservative economists, ensured that taxpayers got less economic bang for their buck than they should have. The Recovery Act saved or created millions of jobs, but it could have done more.\n\nThe death of Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts and his replacement by Republican Sen. Scott Brown increased conservative power, making it almost impossible to take additional steps to improve our economy. Among other policies, conservatives over the past two years delayed and watered down efforts to:\n\n- Provide lending to small businesses and start-up companies\n- Create jobs by offering private employers a payroll tax cut\n- Prevent layoffs of teachers and critical service providers in state and local governments to avoid further weakening of the labor market\n- Extend unemployment insurance benefits to long-term unemployed workers to help keep up economic demand\n\nWhat’s more, if the recently minted “Pledge to America” Republican policy platform is any guide, then devotion to bankrupt—and bankrupting—conservative policies isn’t just an embracing of past policies or blocking of current proposals. It is, in fact, their blueprint for the future as well. Understanding the devastating consequences of conservative economic policies in the 21st century, then, is the aim of this policy memo.\n\n### The Bush-era economy: Laissez-faire too far\n\nPresident Bush’s economic policy agenda consisted of little more than supply-side tax cuts paired with a disdain for prudent regulation. The Bush tax cuts, his administration argued, would put money in the hands of those people best positioned to make investments and create jobs. What we see all too painfully now is that supply-side tax cut policies were, as they have been in the past, [an abject failure](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/report/2008/09/12/4891/take-a-walk-on-the-supply-side/).\n\nThe results are well known, but worth repeating. The tax cuts focused on the wealthy, reversed the federal budget surplus left by President Bill Clinton, and resulted in escalating budget deficits that left our country fiscally weakened going into the Great Recession. And in the 2000s under Bush administration policies, investment growth, employment growth, and income growth [were all at their lowest point](http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/bp214/) of any economic expansion in post-World War II U.S. history.\n\nThese conservative policies simply did not work. Even though the recession ending in November 2001 was relatively mild in historical comparison, Bush administration economic policies contributed to the weakest economic expansion in the past 40 years. The average employment growth over the period between recessions was a mere 0.9 percent compared to the average for post-war periods of economic expansion of 3 percent. Investment growth was 2.1 percent compared to an average of 6.7 percent. And growth in our gross domestic product—the sum of all goods and services cranked out in our economy—was 2.7 percent compared to an average of 4.8 percent.\n\nFamily incomes fell through much of the Bush era, pushing households to take on [record levels of indebtedness](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/regulation/news/2006/05/11/1961/drowning-in-debt/) alongside bankruptcies for those who could not keep up.\n\nBy almost any measure, the period of economic expansion under President Bush, beginning with the end of one recession and ending with the greatest recession of them all, was the weakest in our post-war history.\n\nThe consequences for working families were particularly devastating. Thanks to weak labor markets, family incomes fell through much of the Bush era, pushing households to take on record levels of indebtedness alongside bankruptcies for those who could not keep up. Median family income—with 50 percent of families having income above, and 50 percent below—stood at $63,189 in 2000, but by the end of 2007, after six years of business cycle expansion, median family income reached only $63,471. Under Bush administration economic policies, real median family income grew at an anemic average rate of 0.06 percent annually from business cycle peak to peak. In comparison, on average over the prior four business cycles median family income grew by almost 1 percent annually—or 15 times faster than under supply-side policies.\n\nMiddle class incomes essentially made no progress during the Bush presidency. “No progress” may not sound that bad, but there are two things important to note. First, when incomes stagnate during an expansion, when a recession eventually hits, it cuts into the meat and bone, not just the gravy. Second, what a stagnant median income hides is the vast numbers whose incomes are going down. When the median income is growing strongly it’s a sign that there is a strong economy and most people’s incomes are going up even though by varying amounts. When the median is unchanged it means that while some family incomes are going up, as many are typically going down.\n\nThe country also paid a price for the conservative approach to regulation—or, rather, the disdain for it. Although it is certainly possible to regulate too much and do damage to an economy, the opposite is clearly also true. The financial collapse we have just seen offers the definitive proof of that.\n\nThe system of financial regulation that existed prior to the collapse was flawed, but the practices that lead to the collapse could have been addressed by aggressive regulators operating under that system. That was not, however, the cut of the sails of the regulators that were in power. They were too devoted to their libertarian markets-take-care-of-themselves ideology to take seriously the evidence that market failures were threatening to bring down our financial system, with great detriment to the nation. The result was a financial collapse for which the country is paying deeply and will continue to pay for some time.\n\nThe Bush administration’s conservative economic policies of commission and omission are a primary reason the country is in such rough economic straights right now. Dealing with the structural problems in any economy is a complicated and difficult undertaking, and there would have been a business-cycle recession at some point. But the failure of the Bush administration to heed obvious signs of fundamental weakness and take action leaves our country greatly weakened. And the failure to properly regulate the financial markets was devastating.\n\nIt will take time to overcome the eight years of low levels of productive investment during the Bush presidency, both private and public, and for balance sheets to be restored so that economic actors can buy, sell, lend, borrow, and engage in myriad transactions at levels consistent with a well-functioning, thriving, economy. Unfortunately, conservatives in Congress during the Obama administration decided to double down on their failed policies of the 2000s by obstructing new policies to create jobs and restore the progress of our economy, while demanding only more of the same tried-and-failed conservative policies.\n\n### Less bang for your economic recovery buck\n\nWhen President Obama took office, our economy was in the throes of a major recession and a financial crisis, with the economy shedding jobs at an accelerating rate. The first orders of business: stop the bleeding, stabilize the economy, and put people back to work with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Recovery Act was the first bill introduced into the House of Representatives and the Senate of the new 111th Congress, proposing a range of spending and tax relief to promote public and private investment and household consumption that would create jobs.\n\nFirst, the good news: the Recovery Act was effective. It provided, among other things, $98 billion for public transportation and infrastructure investment, $71 billion for creating green jobs, $116 billion for the making work pay middle-class tax cut—a staple of President Obama’s election platform—an expanded earned income tax credit, and extended emergency unemployment benefits that were set to expire.\n\nThe Recovery Act increased real GDP, lowered the unemployment rate, and increased employment by 1.2 million to 2.8 million jobs relative to where the economy would have been without it.\n\n[Economists Mark Zandi and Alan Blinder](http://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/End-of-Great-Recession.pdf)—respectively, former presidential campaign advisor to Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), and Princeton University professor and former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve—find that the Recovery Act increased real GDP by 3.4 percent, lowered the unemployment rate by 1.5 percentage points, and added 2.7 million jobs to the economy. The Obama administration’s own [assessment from the Council of Economic Advisors](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea/factsheets-reports/economic-impact-arra-4th-quarterly-report/summary) found that the Recovery Act increased GDP by 2.7 percent to 3.2 percent, and increased employment by 2.5 million to 3.6 million.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office [estimates that the Recovery Act](http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=967) increased real GDP by 1.7 percent to 4.2 percent, lowered the unemployment rate by 0.7 percentage points to 1.5 percentage points, and increased employment by 1.2 million to 2.8 million jobs relative to where the economy would have been without it. The business community also found the Recovery Act effective. In a Wall Street Journal Survey of business economists in March 2010, 75 percent of respondents concluded that the Recovery Act resulted in a net positive gain for U.S. economic growth. This is about as close to unanimous as economists get.\n\nBut the Recovery Act would have been even more effective had not conservatives got their fingers in the pie. Although conservatives did not have strong sway in the House, they did in the Senate. At the time of passage there were 57 Democrats and one progressive independent in the Senate—making the garnering of the needed 60 folks a challenge in today’s highly partisan environment. In addition, President Obama and leaders in the Senate wished for this first initiative of the new presidency to be an example of bipartisan cooperation. Given this objective, and the challenge of getting 60 votes, concessions to conservatives of both parties were inevitable.\n\nThe House passed the Recovery Act in just two days—with no Republicans voting for the bill. The House bill came in at a total of $820 billion, providing $545 billion in spending and $275 billion in tax cuts—most of it to be spent in two years. In contrast to the speedy work of the House, conservatives in the Senate held up the Recovery Act for two weeks before allowing a vote. Although the Senate bill came in with a higher price at $838 billion, in the ensuing time conservatives managed to strip money away from job-creating provisions, moving funds to provisions with much weaker economic impacts.\n\nThere were a number of key differences between the House-passed bill and the version passed by the more conservative Senate. One example was aid to state and local governments. With state-and-local-government tax revenues plunging in the recession, those governments (mostly barred from deficit spending) can become a big part of the problem. Pouring laid off public employees into a pool of unemployed private sector workers hurts everyone. Those erstwhile public employees join the laid off private sector workers in competition for what few jobs are available. Adding to the numbers of workers without jobs who are reining in their personal spending means even fewer customers in stores, which means in turn more private sector layoffs and lower investment. Cutbacks in state-and-local spending beyond the salaries of public employees also has the effect of pulling back one of the major customers for the private sector—escalating what was already being called the Great Recession.\n\nConservatives put the pinch on several additional key provisions.\n\nFederal aid to the states is one of the most powerful options for priming economic activity. By preventing layoffs and furloughs of critical public employees (teachers, first responders, and so on) and maintaining public spending levels, aid to the states spurs demand for private sector output and prevents a vicious cycle of spiraling recession. The House bill proposed $172.5 billion to state and local governments; the Senate bill offered $38 billion less. If conservatives had prevailed, the Recovery Act would have delivered [182,000 fewer jobs](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2009/02/09/5619/cuts-to-senate-recovery-bill-mean-fewer-jobs-in-states/) under the lower Senate bill spending on state aid. In the end, Senate conservatives still managed to bleed $25 billion of state and local aid spending from the House proposal in the final bill enacted resulting in an estimated 120,000 fewer jobs.\n\nConservatives put the pinch on several additional key provisions. Conservatives cut President Obama’s “making work pay” middle class tax relief by $26 billion, and cut in half the funds provided for public school construction. For the most part, the provisions that replaced the effective measures that were taken out were far less effective. Take, for example, the $70 billion extension of alternative minimum tax, or AMT, relief that was added. Economists ranked this tax cut second-to-last in job-creating power of available policy options for helping put the economy back on its feet. And, since the AMT relief would have likely passed separately from the Recovery Act it probably added nothing to the economy.\n\n![](http://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/2010/10/img/conservative_econ_chart.jpg)\n\nAnother ineffective provision in the Senate-passed bill was $20 billion tax breaks for businesses to “carryback” net operating losses, or NOLs, for five years. This would mean that businesses experiencing a loss today could deduct the loss from profits they already made and recover taxes they already paid going back five years. With businesses not investing due to the recession and high unemployment, this provision would [line business owner’s pockets without incentivizing business spending](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/tax-reform/news/2009/02/05/5666/corporate-tax-break-puts-the-cart-before-the-horse/) for economic recovery. In the end, the NOLs tax giveaway was scaled back to $1 billion in the final version of the bill. Even conservative economist Martin Feldstein, writing in the Washington Post, was disappointed that some of these tax cuts would “do little to increase business investment and employment.”\n\nAs a result of compromises due to conservative obstruction in the Senate, it is estimated that the $789 billion Recovery Act as enacted would yield half a million fewer jobs than would have been created under the House bill. Even though conservatives ensured the Recovery Act packed less bang for the buck, it is clear that the effects on employment in the economy were immediate and significant. (See Figure 1)\n\nConsider these job figures. Monthly employment losses during the Great Recession peaked at 779,000 jobs in February of 2008, just weeks after President Obama’s inauguration. With the help of the Recovery Act enacted in late February, monthly employment losses began slowing and eventually reversed the negative economic momentum to yield sustained monthly private sector employment gains. The pace of job creation is, however, obviously still not fast enough.\n\n### Darned if you don’t\n\nThe Recovery Act, however, was just an opening salvo of progressive policy efforts to spur job creation. By the summer of 2009 it was clear that more support for economic recovery would be needed. In June, the House passed a bill offering $175 billion for a range of provisions to spur job creation and economic growth, including funds for:\n\n- Public infrastructure and transportation investment\n- Clean energy and water investments\n- Education and school renovations\n- Support of small business lending and investments in innovative technologies\n- Aid to state governments in Medicaid matching funds and COBRA health insurance payments for laid-off workers\n- Extended unemployment benefits, job training, and workforce development\n- Job creation for first responders, law enforcement, and summer youth employment\n\nKnown at the time as the “Jobs for Main Street Act,” the bill actually enjoyed more bipartisan support than most in the 111th Congress—24 Republicans joined with 235 Democrats in voting yea in the House.\n\nBut the bill hit a brick wall with conservatives in the Senate. It languished there for another five months, until November 5, 2009 when Senate progressives were able to overcome conservative threats of a filibuster by cutting the bill down to just $17.5 billion, one tenth of the size of the House bill. Instead of the ambitious provisions in the original House bill, the pared-down bill switched to a small payroll tax cut for employers hiring new workers, acceleration of depreciation of capital investments by business, a small expansion of the Build America Bonds program, and a temporary one-year reauthorization of the highway trust fund. Renamed the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, or HIRE, this more modest help took an additional four months to work out the differences between the House and Senate bills. A full nine months after the initial House Jobs for Main Street Act, during which time the economy lost more than half a million more jobs, the HIRE Act finally became law.\n\nSome of the other provisions stripped from the original Jobs for Main Street Act did, eventually, become law. Aid to state and local governments to save public sector education and police and first responder jobs to provide Medicaid matching funds were enacted under separate legislation—on August 10, 2010, or fourteen months after the House voted on these job-creation measures. In this time waiting for state and local aid, state and local governments lost 292,000 jobs.\n\nThe delay of all these provisions, of course, also means that the impact of these measures has yet to be felt to any significant degree even as the economy continues to suffer. And some of the critical provisions that passed the House never made it through the Senate.\n\nThe infrastructure funding, for example, originally passed the House in November 2009 but fared less well in the Senate. In addition to holding up infrastructure investments that would create jobs in the construction sector where unemployment rates are highest, conservatives also squandered an opportunity to build innovative transportation and energy infrastructures critical to future economic growth. For the past two years, President Obama requested funding for a national infrastructure bank to increase federal transportation investment and to provide billions of dollars in accelerated funding for high-priority projects, including high-speed rail. Most recently, the president called for $50 billion of infrastructure investments on Labor Day 2010 and in October released a [report detailing our nation’s substantial infrastructure needs](http://www.white-house.gov/sites/default/files/infrastructure_investment_report.pdf.) and the many middle-class jobs to be created by making those investments.\n\nConservatives, however, have blocked all action in Congress.\n\nJob-creating fiscal expenditures were not the only things held up by conservatives in Congress. They delayed critical regulatory reforms direly needed to make our financial system stable, accountable, efficient, fair, and productive in supporting investment and growth rather than bubbles and executive largesse. Though far from an ideal policy, the Bush administration’s Temporary Asset Relief Program, or TARP—along with massive intervention from the Federal Reserve—did manage to [temporarily stabilize banks teetering on the brink of insolvency](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/regulation/news/2008/09/23/4957/warning-700-billion-handle-with-care/). But the bigger systemic problems—restoring investor confidence in the integrity of U.S. financial markets and, through appropriate prudential regulation, creating a system of incentives for finance to support investment and growth in the real economy—got kicked down the road to the Obama administration.\n\nThe House passed a sweeping financial reform bill on December 11, 2009; not one Republican voted for the bill. Senate conservatives’ filibustered the bill in efforts to weaken reform, ultimately delaying a vote until May 20, 2010, more than five months after the House. Conservative pressures skewed the Senate reform bill enough to lose the votes of progressive Sens. Feingold (D-WI) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA). With all their rhetorical worship of small business, conservatives should champion legislation to help small businesses access credit amid the financial crisis. Not so.Leaving aside the content of reforms in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, conservative delay of reform created great uncertainty in the financial system that impeded not only a recovery of the financial sector, but a return of normal bank lending and borrowing necessary to fuel recovery in the nonfinancial sector of the economy.\n\n#### Squeezing small businesses\n\nWith all their rhetorical worship of small business, conservatives should champion legislation to help small businesses access credit amid the financial crisis. Not so.\n\nIn May, Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA), Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, introduced the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010. Concerned with the ability of small business to access lending due to the financial crisis-induced credit crunch, this bill proposed a $30 billion small business lending fund and $12 billion in interest rate subsidies to community banks that expanded lending to small business and entrepreneurs. The spending would draw from funds repaid to the Temporary Asset Relief Program, and therefore not affect the budget deficit. By using public funds to leverage private capital markets, the legislation would make available up to $300 billion in loans to small businesses. The House passed the bill just one month later on a nearly party-line vote; with three Republicans voting for the bill.\n\nThe benefits to small businesses and the economy from this bill could not be more clear. Demand for the Small Business Administration loans included in the Recovery Act was so high that the SBA ran out of funds in the spring of 2009, leaving over a thousand small businesses on a waiting list. Helping small businesses access private credit would generate an estimated 500,000 jobs. Even so, conservatives delayed a vote on the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act for another three months as they tried to attach a permanent cut to the estate tax—a tax that in 2009 [affected only 80 small businesses or family farms in the entire country](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/tax-reform/news/2009/12/11/7053/chipping-away-at-the-estate-tax/), all worth at least $3.5 million (or typically $7 million for married couples).\n\n[Conservatives blocked the bill throughout the summer](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2010/07/republicans_block_small_business_lending_bill.php?ref=fpb). All 41 Republicans voted to continue the filibuster in July, leaving the bill for after the August recess and forcing small businesses to go weeks more with the uncertainty over their financial futures. On September 16, 2010, Republican Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio finally broke the conservative filibuster, allowing for another near party-line vote— three months after the House had passed the much-needed measure.\n\n#### Blocking boosts to economic demand\n\nExtending unemployment insurance for workers in the Great Recession was not a political matter until President Obama took office.\n\nOne of the most troubling examples of conservative obstruction to economic recovery is their actions on unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance is both good social policy and among the most sound, best countercyclical economic policies. In an economy in recession with millions of people out of work through no fault of their own, unemployment insurance is the last line of defense for many families to keep up with the rent or mortgage and put food on the table. The Census Bureau estimated in September that unemployment insurance helped keep 3.3 million people out of poverty in 2009.\n\nBut with long-term unemployment—those out of work and actively seeking work for more than 27 weeks—reaching a record high of 46 percent of the unemployed in the spring of 2010 and falling only slightly since then as more people became unemployed—it is clear that 26 weeks of eligibility for normal unemployment insurance is inadequate. Unemployment insurance benefits would need to be extended again in 2010.\n\nExtending unemployment insurance is also good economic policy that benefits everyone. When the economy slows down, unemployment insurance payments kick in to support consumer spending, helping to steer the economy back in the right direction. And unemployment insurance is one of the best policy tools available for stimulating economic activity. [The CBO estimates](http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/112xx/doc11255/Unemployment_Testimony.shtml) that for every dollar spent on unemployment insurance, GDP increases by up to $1.90. Mark Zandi estimates a slightly smaller but still big effect of $1.61 in GDP for each dollar spent on unemployment insurance. Tax cuts favored by conservatives are only one-fifth as effective at boosting the economy.\n\nIt is important to note that extending unemployment insurance for workers in the Great Recession was not a political matter until President Obama took office. Under President Bush, conservatives did not object to emergency unemployment compensation in June 2008, nor did they object to extending emergency unemployment insurance in November 2008 as the recession deepened. The first extension passed the House on a 409 to 2 vote and the Senate 92 to 1. The second extension passed the House 368 to 28 and the Senate on an unrecorded voice vote (although the vote for cloture passed 89 to 6). Conservatives also supported unemployment benefit extensions under President Bush in 2003, as well as [during three other earlier recessions](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/labor/report/2010/09/21/8318/extending-unemployment-insurance-benefits-101/).\n\nPart of the Recovery Act extended emergency unemployment insurance through December 31, 2009. As that deadline approached and unemployment still remained unacceptably high, Sen. Jim Bunning (R-KY) surprised his colleagues by blocking extension of unemployment benefits for days. Sen. Bunning eventually capitulated in the eleventh hour, allowing reauthorization.\n\nThen, in June 2010, Sen. Bunning was joined by several more of his conservative colleagues (including Senate Minority Whip John Kyl (R-AZ), who [claimed most of his party shared the sentiment](http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/07/its-unanimous-gop-says-pay-for-unemployment-benefits-not-tax-cuts-for-the-rich.php)) in again blocking the reauthorization of extended unemployment benefits. Conservative obstruction resulted in the expiration of extended benefits for the long-term unemployed on June 2.\n\nConservatives then repeatedly filibustered attempts to reinstate the benefits, demanding that unemployment benefit extensions be paid for with commensurate budget cuts, and that the deficit-busting $830 billion Bush tax cuts for the richest two percent of Americans be extended but not paid for. Finally Carte Goodwin (D-WV) was sworn into the Senate, replacing the recently deceased Sen. Robert Byrd (R-WV). With this one additional vote, the Senate majority could overcome conservatives’ filibuster of unemployment insurance extension, reauthorizing the critical benefits on July 22. Still, conservative obstruction forced unemployed workers to go seven weeks without benefits.\n\n### Pledging to the same failed conservative economic policies in the future\n\nRepublicans last month unveiled a “Pledge to America,” detailing their “new governing agenda.” This agenda is just recycled, supply-side, Bush economics. [CAP analysis](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/budget/report/2010/09/23/8310/pledge-to-america-not-as-fiscally-responsible-as-it-claims/) shows that putting the plan’s proposals into place would cause the federal budget deficit and debt to grow much faster than they would under President Obama’s budget. The deficit would be $200 billion larger in 2020 under “Pledge to America,” and $1.5 trillion larger by 2030, while the federal debt would rise above 93 percent of GDP with interest payments surpassing $1 trillion a year.\n\nThe deficit spikes under the pledge because massive tax cuts lie at the center of its budget, which extends all expiring tax provisions and makes several big new cuts. Revenues would fall to 16.7 percent of GDP as a result, compared to the 20 percent of GDP achieved last time the federal government ran a balanced budget from 1998 to 2001. The “Pledge to America” promises to set “hard caps” on spending to make up for the lost revenue, but the few details offered don’t add up, leaving deficits and debt to grow unchecked.\n\nThe bottom line is that the pledge merely recycles the same failed Bush policies that caused the six years of jobless economic growth followed by the Great Recession and today’s current malaise in the broader economy accompanied by lots of federal red ink—a relentless focus on tax cuts for the richest Americans.\n\n_[Michael Ettlinger](https://www.americanprogress.org/about/staff/ettlinger-michael/bio/) is Vice President for Economic Policy at the Center for American Progress.

For that reason, we should all welcome and applaud major record labels for their decisive lawsuit against AI generators Suno and Udio, whom they accuse in their complaints of copyright violation on an \"unimaginable scale.\" The complaints make for gripping reading unlike most legal filings, but we're not talking here about sampling various songs… [_\\[more\\]_](https://cfif.org/v/freedom_line_blog/) July 02, 2024 • 06:30 PM [\\[close\\]](javascript:void(0);) | |\n\n- [Home](https://cfif.org/v/)\n- [About CFIF](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/about-cfif)\n - [Mission](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/about-cfif/mission)\n - [Contact Us](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/about-cfif/contact-us)\n - [Donate to CFIF](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/about-cfif/donate-to-cfif)\n - [Employment Opportunities](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/about-cfif/employment-opportunities)\n - [Privacy Policy](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/about-cfif/privacy-policy)\n - [CFIF Staff](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/about-cfif/about-cfif-staff)\n- [Commentary](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary)\n - [Latest Commentary](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary)\n - [Notable Quotes](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/notable-quotes)\n- [The Issues](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/the-issues)\n- [Polls](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/polls)\n- [Donate](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/donate)\n - [Internet Donations](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/donate/internet-donations)\n - [Post Mail Donations](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/donate/post-mail-donations)\n- [Blog](http://cfif.org/v/freedom_line_blog/)\n\n| |\n| --- |\n| |\n| [Record Labels Rightly Sue Abusive AI Music Generators](https://cfif.org/v/freedom_line_blog/26439/record-labels-rightly-sue-abusive-ai-music-generators) |\n| [Image of the Day: Biden's Deficits Exceed Trumps](https://cfif.org/v/freedom_line_blog/26436/image-of-the-day-bidens-deficits-exceed-trumps) |\n| [AEI Scholar: Biden Administration Targeting of Live Nation a \"Historic Mistake\"](https://cfif.org/v/freedom_line_blog/26432/aei-scholar-biden-administration-targeting-of-live-nation-a-historic-mistake) |\n| [Image of the Day: Minorities Prospered Far More Under Trump](https://cfif.org/v/freedom_line_blog/26428/image-of-the-day-minorities-prospered-far-more-under-trump) |\n| [Quote of the Day: Taxpayer Privacy and IRS Abuse](https://cfif.org/v/freedom_line_blog/26424/quote-of-the-day-taxpayer-privacy-and-irs-abuse) |\n| [Image of the Day: Americans' Shrinking Earnings Under Joe Biden](https://cfif.org/v/freedom_line_blog/26420/image-of-the-day-americans-shrinking-earnings-under-joe-biden) |\n| [Image of the Day: \"Bidenomics\" Crushes Consumer Confidence](https://cfif.org/v/freedom_line_blog/26416/image-of-the-day-bidenomics-crushes-consumer-confidence) |\n| [Image of the Day: U.S. Internet Speeds Skyrocketed After Ending Failed Title II \"Net Neutrality\" Experiment](https://cfif.org/v/freedom_line_blog/26407/image-of-the-day-u-s-internet-speeds-skyrocketed-after-ending-failed-net-neutrality-experiment) |\n| [April Fools' Day Four Days Late?

| |\n\nAdvocates of federalism – the belief that, consistent with the Tenth Amendment, as much responsibility for public policy as possible should be given to the states rather than the federal government – have long embraced the notion of the states as “laboratories of democracy.” As originally enunciated by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, this theory holds that, “It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”\n\nChalk up another victory for the Founding Fathers. In a nation now continental in scope and 50 states strong in composition, federalism is more useful than ever. It not only allows states to adjust to the specific cultural contours of their populace, but also allows competing visions of public policy to play out throughout the country, with the ultimate results documenting what works and what doesn’t.\n\nUnfortunately, the results from the 50 state laboratories are not stacked up against each other nearly often enough. How are we to learn best practices for governing, after all, if a comprehensive process of comparing and contrasting public policy outcomes throughout the nation is never carried out?\n\nThankfully, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) has remedied that deficiency with its study “Rich States, Poor States,” the fifth annual edition of which was released earlier this month. Authored by famed supply-side economist Arthur Laffer, _Wall Street Journal_ economic guru Stephen Moore and ALEC’s own Jonathan Williams, the 100-plus page report looks at economic competitiveness among the 50 states in exacting detail.\n\nThe conclusion of the most recent edition: States that embrace free-market principles are beating jurisdictions that prefer big government to within an inch of their lives. As the authors themselves put it, “If we had to summarize the findings of this publication and our comparative analysis of state policy in one sentence, it would be this: Be more like Texas and less like California.”\n\nRiddled with data, “Rich States, Poor States” gives striking testimony to the virtues of unobtrusive government on nearly every page. A comparison between the nine states with the highest and lowest tax burdens, for instance, shows remarkable disparities.\n\nDuring the decade that ended in 2010, GDP in the low-tax states grew by 20 percent more than in the high-tax jurisdictions; Population growth in the low-tax states was nearly four times greater than in the high-tax states. And the low tax rates didn’t exactly make paupers out of the states that embraced them either; those jurisdictions actually realized substantially larger increases in the growth of state and local tax revenue than did their more confiscatory brethren.\n\nTax policy wasn’t the only variable that affected the capacity for human flourishing. The authors also compared and contrasted the performances of right-to-work states with states where union membership is compulsory. The results: GDP growth was more than 10 percentage points higher in right-to-work states. Personal income growth was higher by an almost identical margin. And population growth in the right-to-work states was nearly double.\n\nAny time such disparities in performance are pointed out, liberals are quick to argue that non-political factors – weather or natural resources, for example – are the real culprits. But comparing the numbers in “Rich States, Poor States” gives the lie to that claim.\n\nWarm-weather states throughout the Sunbelt (such as Florida, Texas, Arizona and Georgia) may have been among the top states for domestic immigration, but if climate were the dominant explanation one wouldn’t expect such a dismal performance from temperate California (which came in 49th in the category). Similarly, if frostbitten Massachusetts could blame its travails on the weather (the Bay State was 43rd for immigration), you’d expect neighboring New Hampshire (a low-tax paradise) to do a lot worse than number 22 in the rankings.\n\nNo matter how you slice the numbers, the outcome is always the same: states that embrace conservative policies – low taxes, restrained regulation, free labor markets, a friendly business environment – consistently outperform states where big government carries the day.\n\nConsider this statistic: The 10 states that saw the biggest domestic immigration in the previous decade gave their electoral votes to the Republican candidate for president 76 percent of the time during those years; exclude Washington state (primarily the beneficiary of emigration from liberal basket case California) and the number increases to 85 percent.\n\nOn the flip side, the states that attracted the least new citizens gave their electoral votes to the Democratic candidate 83 percent of the time; exclude Louisiana, whose population loss owed primarily to Hurricane Katrina rather than economic policy, and the number jumps to an astonishing 93 percent.\n\nLiberal Democrats are fond of touting themselves as believers in science, rationality and empiricism. With the results of “Rich States, Poor States” in hand, we now know that to be false. If it were true, they’d have to be conservatives. |\n\n| | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Related Articles :\n\n| | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| - » [Biden's Big Bluff](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/54/6879-bidens-big-bluff) - » [There's a Charlottesville Every Week, and Joe Biden Is Fine With It](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/54/6874-theres-a-charlottesville-every-week-and-joe-biden-is-fine-with-it) - » [Deficit Soars Again Under Biden](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/43/6873-deficit-soars-again-under-biden) - » [True Test of Leadership: Fiscal Responsibility in the Presidential Debate](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/54/6872-true-test-of-leadership-fiscal-responsibility-in-the-presidential-debate) - » [Trump Talks Debate](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/54/6869-trump-talks-debate) - » [Why the Left Hates It When You Point Out We're 'a Republic, Not a Democracy'](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/54/6868-why-the-left-hates-it-when-you-point-out-were-a-republic-not-a-democracy) - » [Democrats Turn Lawfare Into a Campaign Ad](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/54/6861-democrats-turn-lawfare-into-a-campaign-ad) - » [Some 40 Years Later: A Nation STILL at Risk](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/48/6860-some-40-years-later-a-nation-still-at-risk) - » [Biden Points the Bill (and the Blame) Elsewhere](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/54/6854-biden-points-the-bill-and-the-blame-elsewhere) - » [Biden Housing Scheme Could Ignite Another 2008 Mortgage Crisis](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/54/6853-biden-housing-scheme-could-ignite-another-2008-mortgage-crisis) | | | | - » [Social Security Reform Is Coming (Really) and Will Bring Political Rewards](https://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/54/6847-social-security-reform-is-coming-really-and-will-bring-political-rewards) - » [Merrick Garland Shouldn't Be Praised.

That is, until last week, when three politically minded friends came over for an evening of snacks and politics, and, halfway through the evening, I unleashed my new one-two approach to political persuasion.\n\n![](https://cdn-channels-pixel.ex.co/events/0012000001fxZm9AAE?integrationType=DEFAULT&template=design%2Farticle%2Fplatypus_two_column.tpl)\n\nFirst, I asked my friends how they would go about choosing a new dishwasher. We agreed that the responsible and rewarding method would be to ignore any marketing hype and instead follow the Best Buy recommendations by [Consumer Reports](https://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&channel=politics&inlineLink=1&searchindex=property&query=%22Consumer+Reports%22). Because nobody mentioned the virtues or shortcomings of, say, Whirlpool's executives as a valid criterion for choosing the appliance, I asked why they argue for hours about the perceived personalities of the candidates instead of comparing the track records of the major parties. My friends answered that it's simple enough to summarize the essential properties of dishwashers, while the elections are about a large number of issues that defy easy tabulation. Therefore, they concentrate on the candidates, hoping that by choosing the right person for the job, the elected official will make the right decisions when dealing with all those different issues.\n\nI used to share this view myself, but then I checked the numbers. I was surprised to find out that the results of comparing the track records of the two major parties fall neatly (with one exception) into two categories - economy and family values. In my analysis, I compared all administrations going back to 1960 and all states based on how they voted in the presidential elections since 1980.\n\nIt was time for the second phase. I presented my friends with a list of numbers. To overcome bias, I used symbols (A, B, C and D) to represent the two major parties under the two categories. All state-related numbers (including those for the District of Columbia) are per person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n### Economy\n\n**Jobs:** Since 1960, each of the A Party administrations has delivered higher rates of jobs creation than any of the B Party administrations.\n\n**Deficit:** Since 1960, the deficit each of the A Party administrations has passed to its successor was lower than the one it inherited, while each of the B Party administrations has increased the deficit. The average yearly deficit under the B Party administrations was 277 percent higher than the average deficit under the A Party.\n\n**Productivity:** The gross state product of the 20 states that voted for the A Party candidate at least 5 times out of the last 8 elections (let's call them the A states) is 15 percent higher than the other states (the B states).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n**Household income:** The median household income in the A states is 16 percent higher than in the B states.\n\n**Poverty:** The percentage of persons below the poverty level in the A states is 21 percent lower than in the B states.\n\n**Health insurance:** The percentage of people without health insurance in the A states is 25 percent lower than in the B states.\n\n**Advantage:** Party A\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n### Family values\n\n**Divorce:** The divorce rate of the 20 states who voted for the C Party candidate at least 5 times out of the of last 8 elections (let's call them the C states) is 19 percent lower than the other states (the D states).\n\n**Birth to teenagers:** The teenage birth rate in the C states is 38 percent lower than in the D states.\n\n**Birth to unmarried women:** The unmarried women birth rate in the C states is 7 percent lower than in the D states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n**Infant mortality:** Children born in C states are 24 percent less likely to die before their first birthday than children in D states.\n\n**Murder:** The murder rate in the C states is 17 percent lower than in the D states.\n\n**Rape:** The forcible rape rate in the C states is 20 percent lower than in the D states.\n\n**Aggravated assault:** The aggravated assault rate in the C states is 18 percent lower than in the D states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n**Robbery:** The robbery rate in the C states is 10 percent higher than in the D states (This is the one exception).\n\n**High school dropouts:** The dropout rate in the C states is 16 percent lower than in the D states.\n\n**[College](https://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/education/directory/page):** The college graduation rate in the C states is 16 percent higher than in the D states.\n\n**Advantage:** Party C\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nI asked each of my friends to pick the category he or she considers more crucial, and then I showed them the key to the symbols.\n\nThat's when I was rewarded with my first success at achieving a crossover vote.

James William Garrett March 22, 2010 We will take a look at Conservative Beliefs and compare them to Liberal Beliefs. To show how their Beliefs conflict within liberals own beliefs and defy logic and common sense. Conservatives believe in personal responsibility, limited government, free markets, individual liberty, traditional American values and a strong national defense. Believe the role of government should be to provide people the freedom necessary to pursue their own goals. Their policies generally emphasize empowerment of the individual to solve problems. Liberals believe in governmental action to achieve equal opportunity and equality for all, and that it is the duty of the State to alleviate social ills and to protect civil liberties and individual and human rights. Believe the role of the government should be to guarantee that no one is in need. Believe that people are basically good. Liberal policies generally emphasize the need for the government to solve people's problems. Abortion Conservatives believe human life begins at conception. Abortion is the murder of a human being. Nobody has the right to murder a human being. Support legislation to prohibit partial birth abortions, called the \"Partial Birth Abortion Ban\" Partial birth abortion is the killing of an unborn baby of at least 20 weeks by pulling it out of the birth canal with forceps, but leaving the head inside. An incision is made in the back of the baby's neck and the brain tissue is suctioned out. The head is then removed from the uterus. Liberals believe a fetus is not a human life. The decision to have an abortion is a personal choice of a woman regarding her own body and the government should stay out of it. Women should be guaranteed the right to a safe and legal abortion, including partial birth abortion. My comments I find it moronic and totally illogical that liberals do not believe in the death penalty for criminals that commit crimes like murderer rape and child molesters. But they do advocate killing the unborn totally innocent beyond a shadow of a doubt, but it’s just fine to kill babies. How does that make any sense? Why do the liberals have such a big problem with conservatives siding with life rather than the liberals siding with death and somehow they think the choice of death is better and Conservatives are just stupid and we don’t get it. What’s there to get? It is what it is, killing the unborn. Affirmative action Conservatives believe People should be admitted to schools and hired for jobs Based on their ability. It is unfair to use race as a factor in the selection process. Reverse-discrimination is not a solution for racism. Liberals believe Due to prevalent racism in the past, minorities were deprived of the same education and employment opportunities as whites. We need to make up for that. Support affirmative action based on the belief that America is still a racist society. Minorities still lag behind whites in all statistical measurements of success. Also, the presence of minorities creates diversity. My comments It is raciest to create laws that discriminate against one race to give favor to another. That is exactly what Affirmative action is a raciest law. As soon as this law was passed it discriminated against who ever was given favor over another because of skin color. Death penalty Conservatives believe the death penalty is a punishment that if it fits the Crime it is neither ‘cruel' nor ‘unusual'. Executing a murderer is the appropriate punishment for taking an innocent life. Liberals believe we should abolish the death penalty. The death penalty is inhumane and is ‘cruel and unusual' punishment. It does not deter crime. Imprisonment is the appropriate punishment. Every criminal execution risks killing an innocent person. My comments No Death penalty for criminals but its fine to kill babies. That is an upside down and twisted way of thinking. The Economy Conservatives believe the free market system, competitive capitalism, and private enterprise afford the widest opportunity and the highest standard of living for all. Free markets produce more economic growth, more jobs and higher standards of living than those systems burdened by excessive government regulation. Liberals favor a market system in which government regulates the economy. We need government to protect us against big businesses. Unlike the private sector, the government is motivated by public interest. We need government regulation to level the playing field. My comments Liberals favor a market system in which government regulates the economy. This is exactly what Fascism and Nazism believes how an economic system should be run. Do some searches on these types of governments and you will see I am telling you, the truth. Education - school vouchers Conservatives believe School vouchers will give all parents the right to choose good schools for their children, not just those who can afford private schools. Parents who pay the taxes that fund the schools should decide how and where to educate their child. Liberals believe School vouchers are untested experiments. We need to focus on more funding for existing public schools -to raise teacher salaries and reduce class size. My comments The public schools have been unsuccessful since I was in school this goes back to 1972. Nothing has changed now it’s still the same in 2010 or 38 years later and nothing changed. It’s still a very low grade of education teacher’s salaries have quadrupled and the children still graduate with a six grade education and can’t even read. It’s another repeat of the traits of a liberal to keep trying what has consistently failed and to completely ignore what does work and deny the success of anything that contradicts how they think things should be. School vouchers are not untested and they have been around for as long as the public schools have been around. Remember all the stories of how rich kids get the best education from going to private schools. That’s not because there just rich, it’s because private run schools are just better and today there cheaper to run then public schools. It’s all about the Unions that control the schools; it’s not about a better education the liberals would like for you to believe. The Environment Conservatives believe Desire clean water, clean air and a clean planet, just like everyone else. However, extreme environmental policies destroy jobs and damage the economy. Changes in global temperatures are natural over long periods of time. So far, science has not shown that humans can affect permanent change to the earth's temperature. Liberals believe that conservatives don't care about protecting the environment. Industrial growth harms the environment. Global warming is caused by an increased production of carbon dioxide. The U.S. is a major contributor to global warming because it produces 25% of the world's carbon dioxide. The U.S. should enact laws to significantly reduce that amount. My comments Scientists have only been able to measure the ozone since 1985 first liberals screamed about the whole in the ozone then it closed up on its own and the liberals shut up. Then came Global warming being caused by man and it has proven to be a hoax. The science now proves man has little to do with global warming or global cooling. It took $47 billion in tax payer money poured into the liberal toilet to come to that false conclusion that man is the cause of global warming or climate change. Gun control Conservatives believe The Second Amendment gives the individual the right to keep and bear arms. Gun control laws do not thwart criminals. You have a right to defend yourself against criminals. More guns mean less crime Liberals believe the Second Amendment gives no individual the right to own a gun, but allows the state to keep a militia (National Guard). Guns kill people. Guns kill children. My comments The only way you can come to the liberal conclusion that the second amendment doesn’t give the people the right to the people to bear arms is if you don’t read the part that says, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. There is no other way to translate what it plainly spells out in the plainest English possible, unless you don’t read that part. The word in the original bill of rights is separated by a comma separates the militia and the people and these rights shall not be infringed upon. I have an original in my hand as I write this. I don’t need to lie or distort the truth as the liberals always do. Guns don’t kill people or children, people do. If you left a gun sitting on the table and no one picked it up for 1000 years it wouldn’t kill anyone until a person picked it up and used it to kill someone. I once again find the logic of the liberal missing from their statements. It is funny how liberals blame an inanimate object like a gun for the crime of killing, yet the person who picks up the gun purposely to commit an act of murder is innocent. It’s not his or her fault it’s the guns fault. Here is the truth of it all. The liberal progressive know they can’t take over the government and install there communist constitution style government as long as Americans are armed to the teeth as we are. This is also why they hate the military so much, as they take an oath to protect the constitution. It should be obvious by the liberals stated positions on constitutional law that they don’t like it and they want to destroy it. Health care Conservatives believe free healthcare provided by the government (socialized medicine) means that everyone will get the same poor-quality healthcare. The rich will continue to pay for superior healthcare, while all others will receive poor-quality free healthcare from the government. Health care should remain privatized. Conservatives support healthcare spending accounts. Liberals believe Support universal government-supervised health care. There are millions of Americans who can't afford health insurance. They are being deprived of a basic right to healthcare Immigration Conservatives Support legal immigration at current numbers, but do not support illegal immigration. Government should enforce immigration laws. Oppose President Bush's amnesty plan for illegal immigrants. Those who break the law by entering the U.S. illegally should not have the same rights as those who obey the law by entering legally. If there were a decrease in cheap, illegal immigrant labor, employers would have to substitute higher-priced domestic employees or legal immigrants, Liberals Support illegal immigration and increasing the number of legal immigrants permitted to enter the U.S. each year. Support blanket amnesty for current illegal immigrants. Believe that regardless of how they came to the U.S., illegal immigrants deserve U.S. government financial aid for college tuition. Liberals Support Visas for spouses and children to come to the U.S. Families shouldn't be separated. Illegal immigrants do the jobs that Americans do not want to do. Conservatives know these facts In the last debate on Illegal immigration only 18% of Americans wanted amnesty for illegal aliens and 82% were against it. The liberal beliefs would open the flood gates to millions pouring over the border to take advantage of the amnesty. This has been done two times before and that’s what the result was. This also allows the extended families numbering as many as 48 million more people legally coming into the country. Here is the big problem with allowing 48 million more people into the country. The larger the labor forces the cheaper the wages of all people. It works the same as demand and supply. History proves the larger the work force available to employers, the cheaper the wages that have to be paid. Don’t tell me this is a myth because I have firsthand experience and I have worked with Department of immigration on this problem before it became part of homeland security. This is another example of the liberals defying common sense and it’s as if they want to do everything possible to damage the country and its people in every way possible. Conservatives and the people are the enemy from my observations of liberal democrat actions for more then 40 years Religion Conservatives believe the phrase \"separation of church and state\" is not in the Constitution. For a very good reason it’s not in the Constitution. The First Amendment to the Constitution states \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\" This prevents the government from establishing a national church. However, it does not prevent God from being acknowledged in schools and government buildings. Oppose the removal of symbols of Christian heritage from public and government spaces. Government should not interfere with religion and religious freedom. The liberal supports the separation of church and state. Religious expression has no place in government. Support the removal of all references to God in public and government spaces. Religion should not interfere with government. My comments The very wording of the constitution says religion is allowed in public. The bill of rights specifically says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of a religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech. By prohibiting religion in public you are prohibiting religion and the freedom of speech. That would mean the liberal idea of prohibiting religion or prayer in public is against the law and is a direct violation of the bill of rights. The phrase \"separation of church and state\" is not in the Constitution. That is just a fact. The liberal keep insisting it’s there but it’s not. The reason for that is they live in there fantasyland of just make it up as we go. They think you’re stupid and won’t check it for yourself and hoping you will believe that there telling you the truth. It clearly states in the constitution that no laws shall be passed that restrict religious freedom it is stated even in public. Separation of church and state is no were in the constitution, but liberals constantly lie to people and say it is. Same-sex marriage Conservatives believe Marriage is between one man and one woman. Opinions differ on support for the creation of a constitutional amendment establishing marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Believe that requiring citizens to sanction same-sex relationships violates moral and religious beliefs of millions of Christians, Jews, Muslims and others who believe marriage is the union of a man and a woman. Liberals believe marriage should be legal for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender couples to ensure equal rights for all. All individuals, regardless of their sex, have the right to marry. Believe that prohibiting same-sex citizens from marrying denies them of their civil rights. Opinions differ on whether this issue is equal to civil rights for African Americans My comment. Liberals and progressives Democrats are a very sick group of people and I suggest they all see a psychologist and get counseling. Social Security Conservatives believe the current Social Security system is in serious financial trouble. Changes are necessary because the U.S. will be unable to maintain the current system it in the future. Support proposal to allow a portion of Social Security dollars withheld to be put into an account chosen by the individual, not the government. Liberals generally oppose change to the current Social Security system. Opinions vary on whether the current system is in financial trouble. Changing the current system will cause people to lose their Social Security benefits. Support a cap on Social Security payments to the wealthy. Taxes Conservatives support lower taxes and a smaller government. Lower taxes create more incentive for people to work, save, invest, and engage in entrepreneurial endeavors. Money is best spent by those who earn it. Liberals Support higher taxes and a larger government. High taxes enable the government to do well and create jobs. We need high taxes for social welfare programs, to provide for the poor. We can't afford to cut taxes. My comments Liberals support higher taxes to create government jobs that become an ever growing burden on the American tax payer. Government doesn’t create wealth they destroy it. 230 years of American economic history proves this to be true. If you believe otherwise your information is flawed. I suggest you do some research on the subject of economics. You won’t find the truth at a liberal website or a liberal blog. There information is also flawed and it’s deliberate. Liberals say we need high taxes for social welfare programs, to provide for the poor. Look at the section below on welfare. If we grow the economy and create jobs for these poor people they won’t need welfare. United Nations (UN) Conservatives believe the UN has repeatedly failed in its essential mission to preserve world peace. The wars, genocide and human rights abuses of the majority of its member states and the UN’s failure to stop them prove this point. History shows that the United States, not the UN, is the global force for spreading freedom, prosperity, tolerance and peace. The U.S. should never subvert its national interests to those of the UN. Liberals believe the United States has a moral and a legal obligation to support the United Nations. The UN can be effective in promoting peace and human rights. The U.S. should not have acted in Iraq without UN approval. The U.S. should submit its national interests to the greater good as defined by the UN. My comments This is just another example of the liberal wanting to keep trying failed systems. The United Nations has never been effective in any way. They can’t even distribute food to starving people without stealing billions in food aid that the United States paid for they can’t be trusted to do anything humanitarian or peacekeeping. Conservatives believe the United Nations is a waste of valuable resources and should not be consulted about any matters of importance. Bill Clinton once put our troupes under the United Nations flag in Bosnia and that is a direct violation of the constitution. This is just more proof the liberals have no respect for the constitution as they continually support any thing that violates constitutional law and try to make new rules as they go that circumvent or violates the constitution. Shame on them, these are a sick bunch of people that still support and trust this group of thugs. War on terror or terrorism Conservatives believe the world toward which the Militant Islamists strive cannot peacefully co-exist with the Western world. In the last decade, Militant Islamists have repeatedly attacked Americans and American interests here and abroad. The terrorists must be stopped and destroyed. Liberals believe 9/11 was caused by America's arrogant foreign policy. America needs to stop angering other countries. The threat posed by terrorism is exaggerated by President Bush for his own political advantage. My comments Sure it’s our fault by the liberal’s way of thinking, it’s always our fault. The perfect example of this attitude is president Oboma going around the world apologizing for America everywhere he goes. He is a disgrace to the country and his attitude about the United States is a form of seditious treason. Conservatives have the opposite point of view based on facts as we see it and as it is in reality not in fantasyland. America has done far more good than bad. America has become the policeman of the world and what will they all do when we are gone? Welfare Conservatives Oppose long-term welfare. We need to provide opportunities to make it possible for poor and low-income workers to become self-reliant. It is far more compassionate and effective to encourage a person to become self-reliant, rather than keeping them dependent on the government for money. Liberals support welfare. We need welfare to provide for the poor. Conservatives oppose welfare because they are not compassionate toward the poor. We have welfare to bring fairness to American economic life. Without welfare, life below the poverty line would be intolerable. My comments Welfare has destroyed the black American family and keeps those who are poor people poor. They keep voting for their pay checks by voting for the liberal, progressive democrats. There has been no improvement in the lives or standard of living of the poor until they get out of the government social systems. It’s another example of liberals wanting to continue failed programs even after 50 years of complete failure. After welfare reform 12 million people got off the welfare programs and no one starved to death. They simple just went out and got a job. These laws were reversed by Barak Oboma in February of 2010. Being poor should be intolerable so people strive to get out of that situation. If you make them comfortable in there poverty most people will stay in it forever. It seems to me that the liberal progressive democrats represent every social problem in our country. The liberals have created many programs to supposedly fix these problems and every one of their ideas has failed. But yet they consistently want to keep on trying these failed social systems. That’s Albert Einstein description of insanity and this is a conservatives take as well. The liberals own beliefs and their actions are in conflict with their stated beliefs. Liberals say we want to be the best we can be. We want as few people suffering as possible. Yet they keep on doing things that conflict with those goals and create an even bigger and ever growing problem. This is all a distraction from matters of more importance and it’s a liberal tactic, while they change other things we aren’t paying attention to. This is how they got control over all three branches of government. [Conservative](https://www.comparativepoliticseconomics.com/liberal.html) | |\n| [BUY 2012 NOW](http://tiny.cc/ns56s) |"

    "text": "\n \n The basics of liberal vs. conservatives come down to a simple dynamic: liberals are for progress, liberty, equality, creativity, originality, love for one another; conservatives are against them all (though they'll concoct, contrive, contort, conflate and conceal to hide that very fact). Liberals liberate. Conservatives conserve. Liberals push forward. Conservatives pull backwards. So you have pro and con... for and against... progressive vs. conservative. \nby Rusticus \nConservatives are often described as \"reactionary.\" As history goes along, conservatives are defined not so much by what they are for, but what they are against. And because things are always changing, and they don't like change, they are against a lot. \nHere's how it plays out: \n \n CONSERVATIVES \n Favor the Rich &amp; Corporations \nRich and powerful people have a very good reason to promote conservatism. The fundamental core of conservatism is to \"conserve\" (preserve, maintain) traditional customs, institutions and hierarchies. This is a perfect formula for keeping the socio-economic elite rich and powerful, or making them even more so. It's also the perfect formula to keep all other people in their proper places, which, of course, is below and subvervient to the rich and powerful. The father of modern conservatism, Edmund Burke, called this \"the chain of subordination.\" \nAs a matter of \"faith\" these conservative elites believe that they are the superior people, and thus the just rulers of society. Conservatives have referred to this as \"natural law.\" They maintain that if economic, social and governmental policies are skewed in their favor, then all of society will benefit. In economic parlance, this ideology is called \"supply-side,\" though today it is more commonly known as \"trickle-down\" economics, or sometimes \"Reaganomics\" (or sometimes \"voodoo economics.\") This idea goes way, way, way back in history, and has been promoted by every king and pope and sultan and dictator around the world. In all of that time and practice, there is zero evidence that it actually works to benefit all the people, or even the overall economy, of any particular society. What it does do quite effectively is enrich the already rich. And so there is little wonder why conservative power-mongers so stubbornly stick to the \"trickle-down\" formula, and perennially sell it to a gullible public. \nSo, the conservative socio-economic elite are constantly pushing for low, low (or no) taxes for the rich and their corporations, and low, low (or no) regulation on business. They want to skew social systems, including government, toward their favor. They don't really care about the lower classes, including the vast middle class, which is the true engine of a modern economy. They only care about themselves. Indeed, for them to make more and more and more money, and acrue more and more power, it is in their best interest to squash the lower classes. So wealthy and powerful conservatives believe that We the People should serve the economic system, which is rigged in favor of the socio-economic elite. \nDemocracy presents a basic problem for these conservatives because it tends to oppose hierarchical and institutional power. The idea of inherent superiority, subservience, or \"traditional\" power structure runs counter to the values of democracy. So it turns out that much of conservative ideology is deeply un-American (as well as un-Christian). In a democracy, policy, customs and institutions are supposed to be skewed toward We the People, in a system where \"hierarchy\" and \"subservience\" are at least greatly diminished if never completely eliminated entirely. In a democratic society no one is considered \"superior\" just because they are of a particular clan or culture or possess wealth or power. \nYet at the heart of conservative thinking remains the rigid belief in hierarchy, natural rulers, and thus superiority and inferiority. The conservative socio-economic elite are determined to \"conserve\" this separation and inequality if at all possible. LIBERALS \n Favor the Commoner &amp; Common Good \nSince the founding of America, liberals have sought to expand opportunities for the average person, and even the disadvantaged and downtrodden, seeking a more egalitarian society that works for everyone. \nLiberals have a more fact-based, rather than faith-based, ideology. They are not so motivated by self-serving but actually negative emotions, such as prejudice, greed and fear, and thus can see the great advantages to a society of justice for all, and the \"general welfare,\" a term used in the preamble of the Constitution. \nLiberals are \"utilitarian\" in thinking that social, economic and governmental policy should be skewed toward the advantge of the largest number of people, not just the rich and powerful, or toward any particular clan, religion or cultural group. And liberals are far more magnanimous in being willing to share both their wealth (by not being so greedy) and their innate self worth (by not being so prejudiced) with other people. \nLiberals take to heart, and mind, the ideas of liberty, equality, justice for all, and pursuit of happiness: true American values. Liberals also are a whole lot better at extending compassion for all: a true Christian value. And from this real commitment to universal values comes the continual liberal impulse to try to expand rights and steer toward a more equitable and just society. This does not mean that liberals wish to destroy rich people or capitalism, but that these people, and this economic system, must be controlled to the extent that they serve We the People, not vice-versa. \nIn fact, the United States has done far better economically when operating under general liberal principles than it does under conservative ideology. For example, the Great Depression and this latest Great Recession both resulted following an extended period of conservative, \"trickle-down\" economic policy. Taxes were slashed, regulations were relaxed or eliminated, bubbles and mini-booms resulted, the rich got richer, the Middle Class struggled, the poor got poorer, and then the economy crashed. A tragic collapse in the economy - affecting hundreds of million of Americans - has happened twice now in the past 80 years... and still the conservatives won't learn the lesson! \nConversely, the largest expansion of a Middle Class in the history of the world took place under the auspices of the New Deal programs, policy and ideology. In this way, liberals often have to actually rescue conservatives and capitalism from their own web of greed. Barack Obama may have done it again by pulling the U.S. economy back from the precipice of depression that 30 years of \"Reaganomics\" steered us on to. \nNow the conservatives are back, selling the same old snake oil. Mitt Romney offers a tax plan that will lower the tax rates of the ultra wealth even further than the record lows they are at presently. His plan (according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center) will give the richest Americans a $250,000 tax break, while costing the average middle class family with children an extra $2,000 per year. Newt Gingrich calls for zero taxes on corporations. \nThe current Democratic Party (far from actually liberal) favors just slightly increasing the top tax rate so that the richest Americans are paying a fairer share of their wealth, for the good of the commoners and the commons... which is to say, America. To get back to real prosperity, it will take more than this paltry bargaining by the moderates. America will need to return to strong unions, high taxes on the rich and corporations, and stringent regulation on business and industry, most particuarly the financial sector. \n CONSERVATIVES Seek to Subjugate \nBecause conservativism is based upon the \"traditional value\" of strict clan hierarchy, a ranked system of order is to be \"conserved.\" That's a system of ranking, or castes, in which certain people are inherently superior to others. Of course, professional conservatives place themselves over and above other people. This is Burke's \"chain of subordination.\" \nHistorically, conservative policies seek to conserve, protect or expand hierarchies, institutions and traditions that subjugate women, indigenous people, poor people, workers, immigrants and other minorities, non-Christian religions. Slavery itself was a long-running \"traditional value\" of conservatism. \nImportantly, the traditional hierarchy and \"chain of subordination\" also claims ownership of the environment. The \"traditional value\" of conservativism regarding the environment is that natural resources should be subjugated and controlled by the strongest. This ethos spurred hundreds of years of blatant imperialism, exploitation of developing nations and their people, and has led to devastating consequences for the biosphere. LIBERALS Seek to Liberate \nLiberals carried the load in the struggle to uplift and liberate women, workers, children, African Americans, Native Americans, immigrants and other minorities, including gay, lesbian and transgender individuals. Today, liberals are struggling to prevent the erosion of hard-won rights for these same classes in the face of an onslaught of conservative measures to reduce or destroy such rights and power. \n CONSERVATIVES Seek to Disenfranchise \nConservatives habitually seek to restrict rights, protections, including voting privileges (they originally mandated that voting was restricted to white males who owned property, and then only for congressional representatives, not for senators). Likewise, conservatives traditionally seek to depress voter turnout through such means as intimidation, poll taxes, means testing, and registration restrictions which unfairly target the poor. The lower the turnout, the fewer voters professional conservatives have to convince to vote against their own best interest, and the better the conservative's chance of winning. LIBERALS Seek to Enfranchise \nLiberals seek to expand voter turnout, understanding that the greater the number of voters, the greater the likelihood of the liberal candidate or issue prevailing. \n \n CONSERVATIVES Seek to Divide \nConservatives understand their policies serve only a select few, and that they cannot win unless they \"divide and conquer\". They do this by playing upon voters' prejudices, greed, fears and \"wedge\" issue emotionality, often successfully convincing voters to actually vote against their own economic or social self-interest. They also seek to divide America from the rest of the world through bully tactics and unilateral actions. \nIn conservative ideology, it is the individual on his (or her) own, and America separate from and above the rest of the world.\n LIBERALS Seek to Unite \nLiberal positions actually serve the welfare of far more individuals than those of conservatives, therefore their policies are more likely to unite rather than divide. Liberals also seek to join and cooperate with the rest of the world through careful, nuanced diplomacy and organizations such as the United Nations. \nIn liberal ideology, we are all in this together, we work together, we help each other, as Americans, and as nations of the world.\n \n CONSERVATIVES Seek to Exploit \nConservatives by nature are exploiters... of workers, of women, of minorities, of the economy (for the corporation), of the environment. LIBERALS Seek to Protect \nLiberals defend, preserve and protect workers, women, minorities, the economy (for the middle class), and the environment. \n CONSERVATIVES Fear Diversity \nConservatives seek to preserve a white-bread world that supports the primacy of patriarchal, white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant culture, and have little or no interest in understanding or respecting other cultures. Occasionally, they will allow persons or groups who are somewhat similar (i.e. Catholics, minorities) within their tent, but only if it is self-serving. This ignorance fuels suspicion and fear of \"the other,\" and often a tendency to want to subjugate this \"other\", which, of course, generates resistance, animosity and distrust from \"the other.\" This creates a negative feedback loop that is continually reinforced by the conservative, so they remain at war with the world.\n LIBERALS Celebrate Diversity \nLiberals, even though perhaps a part of WASP culture, value a variety of perspectives and cultural traditions, and are more open to learning about them... thereby reducing fear of the unknown. They are free to develop true and lasting trust with \"the other\", and forge a better future that works for all. \nNow don't make the mistake of thinking that liberals endorse diversity for diversity's sake. Not all \"diversity\" is good, by a long shot. Diversity always arrays on a scale, or spectrum. Many scales are quantitative in orientation, where all points on the spectrum are of the same value, but differ in some measurable quantity. Skin tone is one of these scales, complexions contrasting due the amount of melanin; no skin tone is qualitatively better than the other. Age is a quantitative scale, with no age being inherently superior to any other, only more or fewer years involved. Body shape and size is a quantitative scale, none inherently superior, just different configurations. Pretty much all living things array on a quantitative scale, differing not in inherent value but simmply by various, measurable physical properties. Generally speaking, quantitative diversity spectra are safe and healthy to welcome in their entirety into culture. On the other hand, some scales of diversity exists as a qualitative, running from true to false, good to bad. The political spectrum is one of those, it runs from good (liberal) to bad (conservative). Beliefs and behaviors also align upon a qualitative scale, and often entwine both the good/bad polarities as well as the true/false axis. Belief or behavior that is false and/or bad is not the type of diversity a culture should be seeking. A healthy culture will inculcate and nurture beliefs and behavior that are true and good, while shunning and deprecating beliefs and behavior that are false and bad. \n CONSERVATIVES Encourage Conformity &amp; Obedience \nConservatives seek a homogeneous populace that obeys and conforms to their conceptions of \"traditional values\". Anyone outside this populace, whether voluntary or involuntary, is \"the other\", and is subject to ridicule, scorn, ostracization, bigotry, fear, subjugation, and sometimes violence. In this regard, conservatives pay lip service to concepts such as freedom, equality and individuality, but can become very unsettled when these American rights are put to any use which varies from their sense of conformity. \n LIBERALS Encourage Individuality &amp; Freedom \nLiberals recognize that the full exercise of freedom, individuality, creativity and \"the pursuit of happiness\" not only allows non-conformity but in many cases requires it. \n \n CONSERVATIVES Oppose Science &amp; Art \nScience and art often conflict with conservative concepts. When this happens conservatives react with hostility and rigidity. They will not modify their ideology to accommodate modern knowledge and changing sensibilities. Instead, they choose to defend their traditional, often mythological, mindset by denigrating and attacking science and art. Thus the conservative becomes more and more estranged from discovery, truth, creativity, and fun. \n LIBERALS Embrace Science &amp; Art \nLiberals are far more free to learn from and enjoy science and art because being truth-based, not tradition/mythology-based, these high achievements of the human spirit are generally supportive of liberal values and concepts. Additionally, the more astute and sophisticated liberal actually revels in exposure to concepts that challenge their viewpoints and sensibilities, for this enables them to continually refine their ideology to remain in accord with the most modern scientific insights and deep truths that the creative arts often reveal. \n \n CONSERVATIVES Promote Fear \nConservatives cling tenaciously to traditional, mythological, often archaic systems, including clan mentality that fears any threat to established status-quo. That status-quo generally plays in favor of the conservative elite, thus his need to protect it. To do so, he transposes his own fear (though often a distorted, exagerrated version) to his followers to ensure their loyalty. \nA \"boogie-man\" or evil regime is actually an aid in securing such blind loyalty. Thus, you have Ronald Reagan ramping up his belligerent rhetoric against a fading and tired Soviet Union (the \"Evil Empire\"), and Cheney-Bush with their \"Axis of Evil\" and \"terror alerts\" actually encouraging a fearful populace following a domestic attack by 19 guys with box-cutters. \nConservative leaders continually endeavor to frighten their constituents because they want them to turn toward the leaders for \"security\". And so the followers become mere sheep, spooked into falling right in line with right-wing social, political and religious dogma. Thus, conservatives are perpetually the most afraid of all all political classes. \n LIBERALS Promote Hope \nLiberals are much less invested in preserving the status quo, and therefore much less fearful of change to such systems. Instead, liberals can allow themselves to see change as potentially positive and hopeful, even as it overturns some long-held traditions. \nAs for \"boogie-men,\" liberals have been far better at confronting and defeating them than have conservatives... and without having to terrorize their own people. \"The only thing we have to fear... is fear itself,\" pronounced Franklin Roosevelt, rallying American resolve before taking on and defeating two of the most fearsome militaries in world history -- the Nazis and Imperial Japan. \nMore free and less fearful than conservatives, it turns out that liberals are the actual \"free and brave\" celebrated in the Star-Spangled Banner. \n CONSERVATIVES Promote Aggression \nBecause professional conservatives thrive only by keeping a significant portion of the populace in fear, they must maintain an aggressive defensive posture against all real and imagined threats in the world. Macho posturing and the set-up of \"boogie-men\" that serve to bind their followers to them are a staple of conservative word and deed. Such \"boogie-men\" require blustering, continual defense sector build-up, a never-ending escalation of military spending, and/or by actual armed confrontations. \nSuch a military build-up virtually demands war on a semi-regular basis to justify and perpetuate the state of fear and dependency among the populace. As always, conservative leaders don't want a fair fight, they want to rig the game in their favor. So the enemy, the \"boogie-man,\" is usually some disadvantaged or downtrodden people like the Indians or the Mexicans or the Spaniards in Cuba or the Filipinos or the Vietnamese or the Grenadians or the Iraqis or the Afghans or \"terrorists\" hiding out in caves. Fueled by conservative prejudice and greed, the Americans come blustering in with all their overwhelming firepower, claiming to be spreading democracy or civilization, making a mess of things and creating generations worth of hatred, then pull out and declare a great victory. \nSuch war-mongering represents a great victory for the professional conservatives who 1) successfully maintain, or expand, their flock of sheeple, and 2) make millions (or billions) of dollars through their war-making adventures, and 3) clandestinely pass legislation amidst the fog of war that furthers their agenda. It's a win-win-win for them, usually not so much for the nation.\n \n LIBERALS Promote Peace \nNot being nearly as fearful in general, liberals are far more likely to seek peaceful solutions to conflict than conservatives. Liberals are also not nearly so driven by prejudice and greed. So they are suspicious of the \"military industrial complex\" and its natural impulse toward proclaiming \"enemies\" and moving toward conflict and war. \nLiberals are also far less easy to bamboozle when it comes to the \"provocations\" that purportedly require war. Thus, liberals early on saw through the Bush administration's rush to war with Iraq based on the ballyhooed \"weapons of mass destruction\" that conservatives were swallowing down hook, line and sinker. \n However, the notion that liberals are cowardly, or \"lily-livered,\" is sheer myth. When a real (not imagined) threat emerges, liberals are often the first to perceive the threat (as they currently do with unbridled corporate greed), and will defend America as fiercely as any conservative. And they often do so with much greater efficiency, responsibliity and humanity... it is rarely liberal soldiers or officers who are caught demeaning, torturing, or murdering innocent citizens. Meanwhile, the most important American military victories in history came under the watch of liberal Commanders-in-Chief. \nThe commonly used conservative perjorative of a \"lily-livered liberal\" is a vicious myth perpetrated by an evil mentality that deliberately seeks to divide and conquer by demeaning, even demonizing, the other, of just two, political polemics. It is a vile tactic, never even remotely returned in kind by liberals, that underscores the validity of the word \"praetorian\" for conservative.\n \n CONSERVATIVES Employ Deception. \nTo achieve their objectives, conservatives often are compelled to distort and deceive so as to hide their true intent. They have to hide their true intent because conservative ideology is so often counter to the welfare of the common good of the nation and the vast majority of its citizens. It is also quite contrary to authentic American values of liberty, equality, pursuit of happiness, and justice for all. So deception is a perennial conservative tactic. \nNot having enough votes to forward their agenda by themselves, the wealthy elite and corporations successfully connive social conservatives to join with them by disguising and distorting their real purposes, and diverting attention to social \"wedge issues\" which often prompt the social conservatives to vote with the power elite and actually against their own best interests. \nMasters of \"disinformation\", the actions of conservatives are often the precise opposite of their promises. This practice has long been built into conservative strategy. Thus, \"The Clear Skies Initiative\" was a giveaway to air polluters; \"The Healthy Forests Initiative\" a boon for timber companies; \"The Patriot Act\", actually an afront to the U.S. Constitution; the \"Compassionate Conservative\" and \"Uniter not a Divider\" candidate became one of the least compassionate and most divisive presidents; \"Fair and Balanced\" Fox News is, in fact, the least fair and balanced television news channel in American history. The \"No Spin Zone\" conservative television program spins like a whirling dervish. \nTruth has a liberal bias simply because conservatives long ago abdicated truth in favor of mythology and tradition. So conservatives often find themselves in opposition to natural and scientific fact. In such situations professional conservatives deceive, distort and distract, paying for their own \"experts\" who happily \"dissent\" with established science. Meanwhile they encourage their allies in government to postpone or kill solutions to issues that the conservatives do not support. LIBERALS Employ Truth. \nLiberal politicians have been known to exaggerate and sometimes fail to deliver on their promises, but rarely do they need to lie about their intent. And rarer still would be the liberal who does the exact opposite of what was promised. The liberal agenda revolves around helping average people. No wedge issues are needed. No disinformation required. Liberals rely on voters understanding the nuance of issues, and perceiving the holistic truth. Sometimes that is asking too much of the significant section of the populace that are low-information voters and/or are susceptible to manipulation, fear-mongering, bigot-baiting.\n \n CONSERVATIVES Promote Ignorance. \nConservative ideology often clashes with actual facts, scientific discovery and natural truth, so it is in the interest of conservative if the populace remains disengaged, distracted, uneducated and plain dumb. Conservatives hope that the voter has amnesia when it comes to American history, lest they realize how wrong-headed conservatives have been for over 230 years. \nConservatives have actively worked against, indeed fought tooth and nail, every step of progress that our nation has ever made, including, very importantly, every expansion of educational opportunity. And conservative economic policy has always favored the ultra wealthy and coporations. These conservative power-mongers greatly benefitted from the general public not well knowing these very facts. They also are well aware of the inverse: the more education a person gets, the more liberal they generally become. \nIn election cycles they strive to divert attention from the real issues, consistently throwing up smoke-screens of \"wedge issues\" to further confuse and confound a huge segment of the population, as well as happily engaging in the \"politics of personal destruction\" style mudslinging. Anything to keep actual facts out of the mix. Mindless consumerism and entertainment such as sports, video games, most television programming and other diversions also serve the conservative cause. It is no coincidence that such programming often comes directly from huge corporations (run by conservatives) eager to perpetuate the \"dumbing down\" of America.\n LIBERALS Promote Education. \nThe more education an individual has, the more likely they are to tend toward liberal values. Scientists, researchers, professors, teachers, artists, writers, in general the smartest and most educated people in the country are most often liberals. And this is why conservatives are so often at odds with school and university curricula. Truly understanding the history of America means recognizing that this country was founded on liberal ideas, and that each and every stitch of progress made since 1776 sprang from a liberal font. The more information and knowledge a person has, the more they realize that issues can rarely be distilled down to black and white, but require a more nuanced approach. \nIn election cycles, liberals struggle to keep the focus on the primary issues that affect each and every person and family, and not get dragged into 1) tangential issues, such as abortion, gun control, gay marriage, etc. that truly affect only a comparative few, or 2) personal attacks that serve to divert attention from the real issues.\n \n CONSERVATIVES Believe that most Humans are Sinful \nIn keeping with their strict and punitive Old Testament orientation, conservatives hold that evil and sin are the norm within humankind, and therefore a system of order, hierarchy and severe punishment must remain in place. Naturally, the strong and exemplary people (the royals, the nobles, the wealthy and their henchmen) shall be considered the keepers of this order, and all others shall be subject to this \"chain of subordination\" as Edmund Burke, the father of modern conservativism called it. As a result of this worldview of humanity awash in sin and depravity, and the unworthiness of most people, conservatives live in constant fear and separateness from the bulk of humanity. If most humans are sinful, then the world is an exceedingly dangerous place. SO they must ever be on-guard to anything that might threaten their clan. This leads to their ultra-sensitive sensibilities being easily offended by non-normative behavior such as alternative art, music, literature and lifestyles. They are predisposed to consider someone guilty until proven innocent. This negative, pessimistic and fearful view of humanity explains why conservatives have little empathy for \"the other\" and wish no particular \"social contract\" with them. \n LIBERALS Believe that most Humans are Good \nLiberals, if they are Christian (which many are) place more stock in the New Testament orientation of love for one another. Those liberals who are not very religious maintain a secular humanist perpsective which accords dignity, worth and inherent goodness to most people. Liberals are far less prone to being offended by alternative lifestyles or tradition-challenging art, music and literature. They are predisposed to consider someone innocent until proven guilty. With a far more optimistic and positive view of other people, liberals are far less fearful of the world, and therefore are more prone to want to help others and not allow anyone to fall between the cracks of society. \n \n \n \n TO RECAP: \n \nNow that we have a good idea of the official definitions and descriptions of conservatives, let's go straight to the Top 10 Conservative Myths.... \n"
